HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old
retired medical doctor who had percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty [**2184-11-24**], for coronary artery disease.
On workup, it was discovered that he had advanced T2 NO
distal esophageal gastric cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty times two, no history of myocardial
infarction.
2.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is an ex-smoker of greater than twenty
years.  He denied ethanol abuse.

ALLERGIES:  Questionable allergy to Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination was
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the operating room on
[**2185-1-5**], for an esophagogastrectomy using [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
approach by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], assistants Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37699**]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], general endotracheal anesthesia.  Please see
the operative note for full details.

Postoperatively, the patient was doing well.  He had an
epidural and we were using Lopressor for rate control and he
was in the Intensive Care Unit at that time.  He was on
Vancomycin and Flagyl postoperatively.  On postoperative day
one, the patient was transferred from the Post Anesthesia
Care Unit to the floor.  Acute Pain Service was involved with
reverse pain control.

On [**2185-1-6**], at 4:00 p.m. the patient's blood pressure
dropped to 70/40 with the heart rate in the 100s.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation.  Urine output
had dropped to 15 ccs per hour since 7:00 a.m. that morning.
He was bolused.  At 2:00 a.m. on [**2185-1-7**], the patient went
to cardiac arrest and was resuscitated and was sent to the
Intensive Care Unit.  Central lines were placed and the
patient was in grave condition.

The patient's kidney function was slightly affected as he
went into some degree of renal failure with a rising
creatinine which resolved toward his discharge date.  The
patient was intubated and sedated in the unit.  On the
evening of [**2185-1-7**], the patient was extubated and was alert
and confused and was again in atrial fibrillation.  The
patient remained in the unit anticoagulated on Heparin with
chest tubes and nasogastric tube.  The patient's creatinine
at this point had decreased to 1.5 from a high of 2.2.

The patient on postoperative day five, [**2185-1-10**], had
recovered well and was transferred to the floor where rate
control was an issue.  The patient was getting tube feeds and
was NPO.  PCA was discontinued.  Foley was discontinued and
central line was discontinued on [**2185-1-12**].

On [**2185-1-12**], it was noted that the patient's white count had
increased and his back wound was dehiscing.  The middle third
was opened and drainage came out.  He was packed with gauze.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  The patient was confused and a Code Purple was
declared on [**2185-1-13**], and psychiatry was involved.  His
Haldol was changed and adjusted.  Heparin was discontinued on
the patient on [**2185-1-13**], and Coumadin was begun since his INR
was now therapeutic.  For the rest of the stay and
postoperative day number nine, we continued the antibiotics.
His chest tube was put to water seal.  The patient's chest
tube was removed.  On [**2185-1-15**], inferior aspect of the
abdominal wound was showing some drainage and the patient's
diet was being advanced and we continued wet to dry dressings
at this point.  However, the patient was then made NPO.  The
patient's tube feeds continued.

CAT scan was done on the patient and showed question of a
leak.  On [**2185-1-18**], the CT scan questioned a leak, however,
no direct leak was seen as some retromediastinal and
supradiaphragmatic air and debris was seen.  The patient had
a nasogastric tube placed by fluoroscopy on 0/25/02, and
nutrition was once again involved as he was made NPO as
previously stated.  Electrolytes were repleted.

The patient's INR was continuously adjusted to be 2.0 to 2.5
and Lovenox was temporarily used for two days until for a
moment when his INR dropped below 2.0.  At the patient's
behest, a medical consultation was called on [**2185-1-19**], with
regard to controlling his atrial fibrillation.  An
echocardiogram was done to check his left ventricular
function and right ventricular function which came back
normal.  We continued Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Barium swallow CT was done on [**2185-1-21**], which showed the
question of a leak as well.  However, no direct leak was
seen.

The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells
to adjust for hematocrit which had fallen to 22.0 range and
Lopressor was changed to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. in an attempt to
control his atrial fibrillation.  During this time of
admission on [**2185-1-22**], and onward, we were using Lasix to
help diurese the patient.  The patient was complaining of
edema and was noted to be puffy and likely fluid overloaded.

The patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia on
[**2185-1-25**], which was nonsustained and seven beats long and a
cardiology electrophysiology consultation was called.  They
suggested increasing his Lopressor and discontinuing the
Diltiazem which we did.  They suggested a blood transfusion,
discontinuing Diltiazem and Lopressor to be 100 mg t.i.d.
which we did.  The patient's nasogastric tube was
discontinued on [**2185-1-26**], had a CT scan which showed unlikely
to be a current leak since no communication was seen between
the collections and esophageal and gastric anastomosis.  The
patient was allowed to have a clear liquid diet which he
tolerated.

Lung parenchyma with chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
No malignancy identified.
2.  ""Part of thymus and anterior mediastinum"" (A-E):
Adipose tissue with focal collection of macrophages, many
ladened with carbon pigment.
3.  Endobronchial tumor (F):
Non-small cell carcinoma (see synopsis).
4.  4R, node (G-H):
One lymph node, no malignancy identified.
5.  Right lung, pneumonectomy (I-P):
Non-small cell carcinoma (see synoptic report).
Vascular and bronchial margins are free.
Uninvolved lung shows collapse with hemorrhage and chronic
inflammation.
6.  Ribs (Q-R):

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2158-10-24**] 7:15 PM
1. Evidence of viscus perforation with free air seen in the
right lower quadrant. Fat stranding and a small amount of free
fluid are also seen in the right lower quadrant. There is
possible pneumatosis of the cecum. Findings are consistent with
a perforated cecum likely due to ischemia.
2. Scattered diverticula seen throughout the remainder of the
colon without frank diverticulitis.
3. Marked distention of the cecum measuring up to 10 cm. There
is also distention of the ascending and transverse colons. There
is no evidence of obstruction.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2158-10-24**] 5:06 PM
Right subclavian vein thrombosis. Limited examination, as above.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time
of the exam.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2158-10-24**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.

3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is a small pericardial effusion.
8. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2158-9-15**],
there has been no significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2158-11-6**] 8:03 AM
1. Slight increase in the size of the left pleural effusion.
2. No evidence of pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] was admitted to Thoracic Surgery on [**2158-10-16**] for an intrapleural, intrapericardial pneumonectomy with
serratus muscle flap bronchoscopy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection.  For details of the procedure, please see the
operative report.  Upon completion of the operation, the patient
was sent to the MICU as a border for hypotension.  His course in
the MICU was significant for afib/flutter which was controlled
with verapamil and quinidine.  Of note, the patient was
extubated in the OR but which subsequently failed requiring
re-intubation.  He was then extubated the following day without
issue thereafter.  In the MICU, EPS interrogated his AICD after
noting rare PVCs.  Then on POD#3 he was found to be stable
enough and was then transferred to the floor.

On POD#4, patient was seen by EPS for an occurrence of
A-flutter; was refractory to metoprolol and was then treated
with digoxin and diltiazem which converted patient's rhythm to
sinus.  The digoxin and diltiazem was then subsequently
discontinued with no need to start any antiarrhythmics at that
time.  However, on POD#7, patient was noted to have A-fib and
was started on quinidine 324mg (1.5 tabs PO Q8hrs), a heparin
drip and coumadin for anticoagulation.

Furthermore, on POD#7, patient began having changes in mental
status, complaining of abdominal pain and distention and had
need of increased fluids.  Despite having a completely benign
exam and a white blood cell count within normal, he did have an
elevated creatinine and lowered systolic blood pressure.  The
patient was then moved to the ICU, a cardiac echo was done, a
general surgery consult was obtained and the patient was made
NPO and had a nasogastric tube and arterial line placed.  An
abdominal CT showed free air within the right upper quadrant
with significant inflammation/stranding about the cecum/appendix
and questionable distention of the right colon.  His abdominal
exam also worsened at that point and general surgery was
concerned about possible a perforated appendix, colonic ischemia
secondary to the A-fib, or a perforation secondary to [**Last Name (un) 3696**]
syndrome; an exploratory laparotomy was suggested and discussed
with the family who agreed and wished to proceed.

On [**2158-10-25**] patient underwent the exploratory laparotomy but was
found to have no gross evidence of perforation.  It is believed
that the patient suffered a microperforation resulting in free
air but which had subsequently healed.  He was then taken to the
SICU.  On [**2158-10-26**] was restarted on a heparin drip, amiodarone
and also extubated.  On [**2158-10-28**], patient was assessed for
nutritional requirements and found to need TPN which was started
that day.  On [**2158-10-30**] a post-pyloric Dobhoff feeding tube was
placed by Int. Radiology for concerns of aspiration while
attending to the patient's nutritional requirements; TPN was
discontinued on [**2158-10-31**] and patient was moved to the floor.  His
pulmonary exam improved and begin to clear secretions much
better throughout the remainder of his hospital course.

On [**2158-11-6**], a bedside swallowing study was performed for
concerns of regurgitation possibly leading to aspiration; the
study was within normal.  The feeding tube was then discontinued
and patient's diet was advanced to ground solids with boost
supplementation.

On [**2158-11-8**], patient had 3 occurrence's of his AICD firing
during the QRS complex.  This was discussed with EPS who
recommended that the patient be switched to amiodarone 400mg PO
QD and be seen at his Rehab facility this week by Cardiology for
possible AICD interrogation and further management.  Patient was
then discharged on the same day to [**Hospital3 105**] in good
condition, ambulating and tolerating a ground diet.  His INR was
therapeutic and he was placed on 4mg of coumadin PO QHS; the INR
is to be checked twice a week on Thursdays and Mondays and the
coumadin dosage adjusted accordingly.  Furtermore, he is to be
discharged with a 7 day course of levofloxacin 500mg PO QD.  He
is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in 1 week, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] in

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
male who in late [**Month (only) 216**], early [**Month (only) **] developed an upper
respiratory infection.  After his symptoms failed to improve,
he underwent evaluation with radiography which eventually
demonstrated a collapsed right upper lung with a right upper
lobe hilar mass.  Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy
demonstrated a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.  Mediastinoscopy
was negative for mediastinal involvement.  The patient's
postoperative course was complicated by respiratory
insufficiency requiring intubation.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] where a rigid
bronchoscopy and debridement of the right main stem
endobronchial tumor opening up the right lower and right
middle lobe.   A stent was also placed in the right main stem
bronchus to maintain patency.  The patient was discharged and
now returns to the Thoracic Oncology Multidisciplinary Center
for evaluation.

It was decided to treat the patient with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy/radiation to be followed by possible sleeve
lobectomy.  Since that time, the patient has completed
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  A repeat chest CT scan showed
significant regression of the tumor within the right upper
lobe bronchus to the point the right upper lobe was back
spanned.  There was no significant reduction of the tumor
mass at the tracheobronchial angle.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Herniated discs.
2.  Possible myocardial infarction.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Oxycontin.
2.  Percocet.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  the patient smoked one and one half packs a
day for forty years.  He continued to smoke up to eight days
ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died of lung cancer.
Mother died of diabetes mellitus.  Sister currently has
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a well developed male
in no apparent distress.  Temperature is 97.3, pulse 72,
oxygen saturation 97% in room air, blood pressure 100/64.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - sclera is anicteric.
Neck - no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy.  Lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate
and rhythm without murmur.  The abdomen is soft without
masses.  Extremities - inguinal and groin regions have no
lymphadenopathy.  Extremities show no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2126-3-4**], and
taken directly to the operating room where a bronchoscopy and
right pneumonectomy was performed.  The patient initially
tolerated the procedure quite well.  He had a chest tube in
place.  He was on perioperative Kefzol and managed by acute
pain service.  Chest tube was removed on postoperative day
one, perioperative Ancef was continued for one week.  The
patient was advanced on his diet.

Unfortunately on postoperative day number two, the patient
started to experience some respiratory distress that over the
course of the day was progressive to the point the patient
required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring.  The patient received in the Intensive Care Unit
two units of packed red blood cells for anemia.  The patient
received Lasix in an attempt to decrease what initially
appeared to be fluid on the lung.  The patient was put on
broad spectrum antibiotics, initially Levofloxacin and Flagyl
and then Zosyn.  It was finally decided the patient had a
post pneumonectomy contralateral lung respiratory distress
syndrome associated with inflammation.  The patient was
started on Epogen.  Over the course of the next several days,
the patient required aggressive pulmonary treatment including
CPAP and steroids.  When the patient was adequately stable,
he was transferred back to the regular Cardiothoracic floor
where he slowly improved.  The patient did essentially
require aggressive respiratory therapy including oxygen and
periodic nebulizer treatments.  It was felt by the team that
the patient will benefit from a period of rehabilitation in
an acute pulmonary rehabilitation setting.  For that matter,
he is being discharged tomorrow in stable condition to acute
pulmonary rehabilitation facility.  He will need to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in one to two weeks.  The patient may shower
but not take any baths.  He should avoid driving while on
pain medications.  He should avoid strenuous activity.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left lower lobe lung mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year old
female first seen by the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service in
[**2140-6-7**].  The patient had presented in the Emergency
Department with confusion, word-finding difficulty, and
cognitive slowing.  Computerized axial tomography scan of her
head as well as an magnetic resonance imaging scan performed
in [**Month (only) 216**] showed a 3 cm left frontal and a left parietal
metastases.  There was some extensive surrounding edema at
the time with some compression of the body of the left
lateral ventricle.  Both of these metastases were
subsequently removed on [**2140-7-28**].  Pathology was
consistent with adenocarcinoma.  A computerized axial
tomography scan of the chest performed on [**2140-7-27**]
showed a mass in the left lower lobe.  She had stereotactic
radiosurgery to the left frontal and left parietal surgical
bed in [**2140-9-7**].  She has subsequently underwent four
cycles of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin chemotherapy.  The
patient was followed following these procedures and was
neurologically and psychiatrically stable at the beginning of
[**2141-2-6**].  Following further workup there was no evidence
of further metastatic disease and given the patient's young
age, the Oncology Division as well as the Thoracic Surgery
staff felt that the patient's survival may benefit from
surgical resection of the lung mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Metastatic lung cancer as
mentioned above.  2.  Left foot drop.  3.  Osteomyelitis of
the left lower extremity.  4.  Bilateral lower extremity
edema times approximately nine months (etiology unclear.  The
patient has required Lasix for control.  The patient has also
required increasing doses of narcotic medications to control
lower extremity pain believed related to that edema.)  5.
Traumatic splenectomy, effusion of the right wrist,
straightening of the left great toe subsequent to
osteomyelitis.  6.  Right breast duct excision.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Senna b.i.d., Aldactone 50 mg p.o.
q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., Compazine prn, Fentanyl
patch 75, Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., Effexor 37.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lasix 100 mg p.o. q.d., Aleve prn, Dilaudid prn,
Klonopin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and has a large
involved family.  The patient worked as a manager at a [**Company 15428**].  The patient has been a heavy smoker in the past.
The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2141-2-7**], and taken
to the Operating Room where she underwent a left lower
lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection and lysis of
adhesions.  The procedure was uncomplicated with an estimated
blood loss of 150 cc.

In a postoperative area the patient was noted to have a new
left hemiparesis.  The patient was also somnolent.  An
emergent computerized axial tomography scan of her head was
obtained which revealed a large area of hemorrhage in the
right temporal and parietal region.  There was also over 1 cm
right to left some sloughing herniation.  A Neurosurgery
consultation was requested and the patient was emergently
taken to the Operating Room for evacuation of the hematoma.
The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
while intubated and sedated.  On postoperative day #1, the
patient was able to open her eyes to noxious stimuli but was
not following commands.  She was moving all four extremities
spontaneously but with the right being significantly stronger
than the left extremities.  The patient was on Dilantin and
Decadron as well as the Nitroprusside drip for blood pressure
control.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day #1.
On postoperative day #2, the patient required reintubation
for extreme agitation where the patient attempted to get out
of bed, pulling her line and flashing on her bed.  Following
intubation, the patient had a bronchoscopy performed for
copious secretions.  The bronchoscopy revealed that her left
lower lobectomy stump site was intact with no bleeding.
There was copious clear sputum on the right.  A
bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and specimens were sent
for cultures.  The sample ultimately grew Serratia.  The
patient had been started on Levofloxacin postoperatively and
subsequently completed a 14 day course.  Over the following
few days, in the Intensive Care Unit the patient's
medications were titrated to minimize her agitation.  Her
neurologic status remained largely stable.

On postoperative day #5, the patient pulled out one of her
chest tubes.  The site was immediately dressed appropriately
and a chest x-ray performed which revealed no evidence of
pneumothorax.  The patient's second chest tube on the right
side was removed later that day by the thoracic surgery team.
Following the removal of the chest tubes, the patient had a
chest x-ray which revealed a significant pneumothorax.  A
pigtail catheter was placed into the pneumothorax for
decompression on postoperative day #6.  At this time, the
patient remained disoriented, confused and mildly agitated.
On postoperative day #7 the patient was started on tube feeds
and her Decadron was ultimately weaned off.  On postoperative
day #9, the patient had a bedside swallow evaluation.
However, the patient did not cooperate much with the
examination and it was believed that she could tolerate thin
liquids and pureed foods under strict supervision while
upright.  Over the following few days, the patient made some
slight improvement, but on the morning of postoperative day
#13 was noted to be significantly improved.  The patient
remained confused but easily reoriented.  She was moving all
extremities spontaneously and purposefully.  She was
following some simple commands, although inconsistently.  She
remained intermittently agitated but could be calmed down
with the family present.  The patient's Ativan drip was
weaned off and her Decadron was discontinued.  On
postoperative day #14, the patient was transferred to the
regular floor.  She was maintained on 1:1 observation.  She
appeared somewhat sleepy.  The Neurology Team which had
followed the progress of the patient recommended that her
Ativan be slowly weaned.  This was initiated.  The patient at
that time was beginning to take more regular food by mouth.

On postoperative day #15, the patient pulled out her
nasogastric feeding tube.  Given that the patient was
beginning to eat more, the decision was made not to replace
the tube.  By the evening of postoperative day #15 the
patient was clearly eating much better.  She was calmer,
responding appropriately to questions, moving all extremities
and still had some slight weakness on the left.

Discharge planning had been initiated following the [**Hospital 228**]
transfer to the floor.  By postoperative day #16, the patient
was deemed ready for discharge.  By that day the patient was
able to converse somewhat fluently, although requiring
frequent prompting to recall some details.  Her pain was well
controlled.  The patient had a very good appetite and was
tolerating her food with no problems.  The patient was able
to ambulate a short distance out of her room with a walker
although she would drift to one side with ambulation and
required guidance.  The patient's pigtail catheter into the
chest had been removed without complications.  The patient's
laboratory data were essentially normal.  Her white count had
been stable in the 14 to 15 range during the four days prior
to discharge but on [**2-23**], her white count had dropped to
10.3.  The patient had been afebrile essentially throughout
her admission.  The patient was to be discharged for
neurological rehabilitation when a bed became available.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable from a thoracic surgery
standpoint and improving from a neurological standpoint.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Adenocarcinoma of the lung, left lower lobe.
2.  Hemorrhagic stroke, right parietal area.

FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**], her
thoracic surgeon, in clinic one week following discharge.
2.  The patient is to follow up with the Neurology Service.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with complaint of shortness of
breath.  The patient is a 43 year-old male with a history of
poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed in
[**2175-10-17**] status post radiation therapy and
chemotherapy and tracheal stent for malignant obstruction,
now here status post intubation for respiratory failure.  The
patient was most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2-5**] to the 30th with obstruction of
trachea and main bronchus for bronchoscopy and stent
placement.  The patient was found also to have post
obstructive pneumonia and started on Ceftriaxone and
Metronidazole.  The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 511**]
[**Hospital 13247**] rehab.  CT scan at [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2-21**] showed
bilateral pneumonia, bilateral pulmonary metastases,
subcutaneous right chest wall mass and moderate pericardial
effusion.  Radiation therapy on [**2-22**] to the right chest
wall mass, Gemzar planned for [**2176-2-27**] at [**Hospital3 7778**].  The patient experienced increased shortness of
breath since [**2-25**] with poor air movement.  No response
to nebulizers and morphine and the patient reversed his do
not intubate status, but remained do not resuscitate.

On arrival to the Emergency Room the patient was sinus
tachycardic 140s to 150s.  Blood pressure 157/97.

to be married.  Fiance was his health care proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.0.  Blood pressure
90/58.  Heart rate 120s.  Respiratory rate 20s.  O2 sat 99%
on the vent of pressure support, 100% FIO2, pressure support
of 20, PEEP of 15, arterial blood gas was 7.25, 70, 325, and
32.  He was uncomfortable, intubated, dyspneic.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  No JVD.  Decreased breath sounds
globally, 3 cm mass on the right chest wall.  He was
tachycardic.  Abdomen was soft, nontender.  There was no
edema in his extremities.  He was awake and answering
questions.

White blood cell was 91.9000, hematocrit 38.3, platelets 585,
INR 1.2, BUN and creatinine 22 and .8, fibrinogen 978.
Lactate was 1.9, sodium 135, potassium 5.1, amylase 22, serum
tox was negative.  Chest x-ray had right middle lobe opacity,
bilateral worsening densities.  Bronchoscopy revealed a mass
obstructing the airway in the trachea unable to press scope
beyond the endotracheal tube.

The patient was taken to rigid bronchoscopy.  During the
rigid bronchoscopy the tracheal tumor tissue was removed with
rigid forceps.  No discernible airways were seen in the left
lung.  The right middle lobe stent was seen and filled with
mucus and tumor tissues, which were removed with suction.
Distal lumen of the right lower lobe were seen.  The patient
became hypoxic and had a pulseless electrical activity arrest
and expired on [**2176-2-26**] during the rigid
bronchoscopy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung cancer with pulseless electrical activity arrest.

Date of Birth:   [**2053-9-23**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 22631**] is a 71 year-old
female with a history of lung cancer status post left lung
resection in [**2122**], status post Taxol, Carboplatin and
radiation therapy and now with recurrent lung cancer at the
right hilum status post right sided endobronchial stent as
well as carboplatin, Taxol and radiation therapy to the right
side as well, which was completed at the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**].
She now presents with a chief complaint of six days of
progressive shortness of breath, fevers to 101, chills and
dry cough.  She was initially treated with a X-pack for
presumed community acquired pneumonia, but had worsening of
symptoms.  She subsequently presented to the Emergency Room
and there was noted to be in severe respiratory distress and
hypotensive with significant oxygen requirement.  She was
subsequently intubated.  A chest x-ray showed diffuse right
sided infiltrates.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Lung cancer, details as per
history of present illness.  2.  Diverticulosis.  3.  Atrial
fibrillation.  4.  Procainamide arthritis.  5.
Hypercholesterolemia.  6.  Depression.  7.  Seasonal
allergies.  8.  Hemangioma of the liver.  9.  Status post
tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Zithromax, Pravachol, Ativan prn, Celexa.

ALLERGIES:  Procainamide and Bactrim.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with husband.  Retired bank clerk.
Forty pack year smoking history quit ten years ago.
Occasional alcohol.  She has four sons.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.3.  Blood pressure
95/50.  Heart rate 135.  Respirations 36.  74% saturation on
nonrebreather.  In general significant respiratory distress
speaking in incomplete sentences, tachypneic.  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  No JVD.  Diffuse rales in the right lung fields.
Decreased breath sounds on the left.  Regular rhythm,
tachycardic.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities no edema.  2+ distal pulses.
Neurological grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  Chest x-ray diffuse right sided infiltrates.
White count 15.5, hematocrit 35, platelets 394.  Differential
91% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated
for clinical respiratory distress and hypoxia.  She
subsequently developed adult respiratory distress syndrome
presumed secondary to right sided pneumonia versus radiation
pneumonitis versus both.  She was maintained on the
ventilator with SIMV mode ventilation and required high
levels of FIO2, PEEP to maintain oxygenation as well as a
significant high respiratory rate to maintain appropriate
ventilation in the setting of low tidal volume due to her
single lung.  She was started on Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin
and Flagyl for coverage of pneumonia.  Her Ceftriaxone was
subsequently discontinued and she was continued just on
Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  She was also started on high dose
steroids for radiation pneumonitis.  Over the course of her
hospitalization she continued to have significant oxygenation
problems and continued to require high respiratory rates to
maintain appropriate ventilation.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was hypotensive and required
pressors for blood pressure support.  Her hypotension was
presumed due to sepsis.  The patient was initially listed as
full code on admission.  Upon further discussion with the
family it was revealed that the patient had not wanted
aggressive care and family members decided to withdraw
support given her grim prognosis both from her underlying
metastatic lung cancer and her severe adult respiratory
distress syndrome.  It was determined that her baseline
functional status was poor and that even if she were to
recover from her acute lung injury she would not return to
even her poor baseline functioning.  Her ventilatory support
was withdrawn on [**5-14**] and the patient subsequently passed
away.

CXR [**2110-1-24**]: Chest, a single AP upright view at 11:30 p.m. is
interpreted without prior films available for comparison. There
is a right subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in
proximal SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The lungs
are clear with linear atelectasis in left lung base. No pleural
effusion is seen, however the right costophrenic sulcus is not
entirely included on the film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
appears normal.
.
CT Chest [**2110-1-25**], post-bronch:
FINDINGS:  There is extensive central adenopathy, most
pronounced at the left hilus and widespread in the mediastinum.
The left lower lobe bronchus is occluded by the hilar mass at
the level of the superior segment producing severe volume loss
in the lower lobe and heterogeneous consolidation distally,
either atelectasis or postobstruction pneumonia.  Adenopathy
extends centrally posterior to the left main bronchus to a 31x16
mm subcarinal mass.  Enlarged lymph nodes are present throughout
the right and left upper and lower paratracheal stations
including a 15-mm wide node posterior to and inseparable from
the right subclavian artery, image 2:9.
.
Severe narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein and milder
generalized
narrowing of the superior vena cava are not due to mass and
probably represent strictures from long-term catheterization.
Small pericardial effusion is present with no indication of
tamponade.  Study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation except to note the absence of adrenal mass or obvious
hepatic metastasis.  There are no lung nodules, consolidation or
interstitial abnormality except for subpleural findings in the
right lung base probably due to dependent atelectasis.
.
There is heavy calcification in the aortic valve which could be
hemodynamically significant.
.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Obstructing left hilar mass producing severe left lower lobe
atelectasis and/or obstructive pneumonia.  Extensive bilateral
mediastinal adenopathy and small pericardial effusion suggest
widely metastatic carcinoma.
2.  Possible calcific aortic stenosis.
3.  No evidence of opportunistic infection.
4.  Strictures, left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena
cava.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to the MICU and taken by interventional
pulmonology to Bronch overnight.  There there found an extensive
submucosal irregularity in LLL bronchus c/w SCLC recurrence.
They took a sample for biopsy (pathology pending at tiem of
transfer) and used Argon Laser tx to cauterize the lesion.  Pt.
was monitored in the MICU overnight with no further episodoes of
hemoptysis.  A CT of the Chest was obtained to eval for SCLC
recurrence, and prelim radiology read showed LLL consolidation
and that LLL bronchus was not patent, along with L paratracheal
and hilar [**Doctor First Name **] (final Radiology read pending at time of
transfer).  His hct was stable over admission (38 -> 40 -> 39),
and he was transferred to the floor after a night of ICU
monitoring for further management.
.
On the floor Radiation Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **].  They recommended
urgent radiation of LLL lesion to prevent further hemoptysis.
As pt's Oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], is at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
and he has received his Chemo and Radiation there in the past, a
decision was made to transfer him back there for evaluation for
Radiation Tx.  Arrangements were made for the pathology from the
biopsy and for a copy of the CT scans to be sent to [**Hospital 8**]
hospital.
.
Psychiatry saw the pt. on the floor and felt that he was stable
from a Psychiatry standpoint for discharge, as he had no further
SI and was less Depressed than he had been on admission to

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen.
A calcified spherical mass (2.6 by 2.6 cm) is present in the
para-aortic
region abutting the posterior wall of the left atrium.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 yoM with stage IV NSCLC complicated by tracheoesophageal
fistula s/p stents transferred from OSH with likely aspiration
pneumonia and dysphagia. Transferred from MICU [**10-16**].
.
1. Pneumonia. The patient was empirically treated with
vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration and hospital-acquired
pneumonia. The patient was discharged on levofloxacin per
interventional pulmonology recommendations to complete a 14-day
course when sensitivities returned on the bronchoalveolar
cultures as above. The patient was given supplemental oxygen and
continued on nebulizers, guaifenesin and tessalon perles as
needed. Interventional pulmonology followed the patient
throughout hospitalization.
.
2. Dysphagia. Upper endoscopy showed patent stent as above. The
patient was followed by gastroenterology and speech and swallow
during hospitalization. Video swallow performed with results as
above. The patient was instructed not to use straws.
.
3. Lung cancer. Staging/treatment, tracheoesophageal fistula as
above. The patient was followed by his oncologist during
hospitalization. Interventional pulmonology followed the patient
throughout hospitalization. The patient received three
bronchoscopies with successful stent placement. The patient was
continued on pain control as needed. The patient was scheduled
for follow-up with oncology on discharge. The patient will
return in [**4-18**] weeks for repeat bronchoscopy to assess stent
position.
.
4. Shortness of breath. Improved on discharge. Likely
multifactorial secondary to lung cancer, pneumonia, and anemia.
Treatment as above.
.
5. Anemia. Likely secondary to chemotherapeutic agents and
anemia of chronic disease. The patient was continued on Epogen.
Iron studies were not able to be performed prior to blood
transfusion. Hemolysis and DIC panels were negative. The patient
was transfused one unit packed red blood cells prior to transfer
from the OSH and was transfused one unit during this
hospitalization two days prior to discharge. The patient's
hematocrit bumped appropriately and remained stable.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia. Most likely secondary to chemotherapeutic
agents. Stable. The patient was followed by his oncologist
during hospitalization.

output are 1,473 in, 560 out.  White count of 27; hematocrit
of 32.1 and platelets of 272.  Electrolytes within normal
limits.

The patient's epidural was continued for pain control.  A
chest x-ray was ordered. Neo was weaned. Diet was advanced.
Epidural was kept at a lower dose, secondary to decreasing
blood pressures.  On postoperative day number three, the
patient was on a Neo drip of 1.25, afebrile, with a heart
rate of 83; blood pressures of 103/63; 97% on six liters
nasal cannula/face mask.  Input and output were 2,118 in, 865
out in urine.  The patient had crackles at the right base.
White count was decreasing at 12.9; hematocrit of 33.2;

base excess or deficit.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
four, doing well with epidural catheter capped. Blood
pressures in the low 100's systolic.  Chest x-ray is being
followed and oxygen being weaned.  The patient's Foley
catheter was discontinued on postoperative day number five.
The patient was kept on p.o. medications for pain control,
otherwise doing well with rehabilitation center planning.
The rest of the hospital course was unremarkable.  The
patient's vital signs were stable with right lung clear to
auscultation, ambulating, voiding, using incentive
spirometry.  The patient was discharged to extended care
facility on postoperative day number seven, in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Bronchoalveolar carcinoma.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Right upper lobe lung mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Right thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy with pleural tent
2.  Cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy.
3.  Mediastinal nodal dissection.
4.  Flexible bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a delightful 78-year-old gentleman with severe
COPD who was noted to have a small right upper lobe nodule in
[**2189**] and has been followed with serial imaging since. At that
time, a PET/CT scan showed no evidence of FDG activity within
the lesion. Due to his severe COPD, he was followed carefully.
Subsequent CT scans demonstrated growth in the lesion, which is
nearly doubled in size overall. In addition, there has been the
appearance of a new second nodule in the posterior segment of
the right upper lobe, which has also grown with time. These
nodules were separated by about 3-4 cm and normal lung tissue. A
recent PET/CT scan obtained in [**2193-6-25**] demonstrated FDG
uptake within both right upper lobe nodules as well as two small
lymph nodes adjacent to the left parotid gland. There is no
uptake within the mediastinal lymph nodes or of elsewhere within
the body of concern. He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2193-7-16**], which showed no endobronchial lesions, and a
bronchoalveolar lavage was nondiagnostic. He subsequently
underwent a CT-guided
fine needle biopsy on [**2193-8-2**], which confirmed the
presence of an adenocarcinoma consistent with bronchoalveolar
type.  The patient presents for surgical resection of his right
upper lobe.

He does suffer from dyspnea on exertion becoming dyspneic after
walking up two flights of stairs. He is able to walk
approximately three blocks without much dyspnea.

Other than some nocturia, he has otherwise been asymptomatic. He

specifically denies chest pain, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain,
fevers, chills, sweats, recent pulmonary infection, weight loss,

anorexia, or new neurological or new musculoskeletal complaints.

All other systems reviewed were otherwise negative.

Past Medical History:
1. severe COPD
2. spontaneous pneumothorax in [**2184**] on the right
3. prostate cancer treated with radioactive seed in [**2189**]
4. hemorrhoidectomy
5. decreased hearing.


Social History:
He is married, lives with his family. He smoked two packs a day
for 50 years, continues to smoke one pack per week. He worked as
a boiler man and also worked in the navy and was exposed to
asbestos. He has no significant alcohol use.


Family History:
COPD and lung cancer in siblings.

CXR - [**12-31**]
The right apical pneumothorax appears a tiny bit larger than it
was on the last two chest radiographs, although the change is
marginal. Otherwise, the right lung volume loss, pleural
thickening, and mediastinal shift remain stable. The right-sided
chest tube is unchanged in position. Chain sutures are again
noted in the right suprahilar region. There are now asbestos-
related pleural calcifications and aortic calcification. Heart
size is unchanged.

CONCLUSION: Minimally increased right apical pneumothorax,
likely insignificant and related to projection. Otherwise,
stable appearance.

[**12-23**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE.
2. Severe emphysema. Calcified pleural plaques.
3. Small residual right pneumothorax. Two right-sided chest
tubes appear in good position.
4. 3.1-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm. Extensive atherosclerotic
disease.
5. Small hypodense lesions in the liver are incompletely
characterized but may represent cysts or hemangiomas.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and had a right thoracoscopic right
upper lobectomy, cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy,
mediastinal nodal dissection, and flexible bronchoscopy which he
tolerated well.  The patient had a chest tube and a mediastinal
drain placed in his right pleural space.  This was placed to
suction with a leak present.  On post-op day 1, the patient had
an episode of repiratory distress with SaO2 in the 80s on 3
liters O2 via nasal cannula.  Wheezes and rhonchi were
auscultated.  The patient was given albuterol/ipratropium
nebulizer treatments, nasal canula was switched to shovel mask,
and SaO2 increased to 100%. An ecg showed no acute changes.  On
post-op day 2, the patient had another episode of respiratory
distress and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
The patient was started on Levoquin empirically.  Steroids were
also started for the patient's history of COPD.  In the ICU, the
patient also developed atrial flutter.  The patient was placed
on a diltiazem drip and converted back to sinus rhythm.  Serial
ABGs were obtained to ensure that the patient was not becoming
hypoxemic or hypercarbic. On [**12-21**] chest tube was d/c'd, [**Doctor Last Name **]
was left to bulb.  He had an episode of destauration in the ICU
that reslved after bronchoscopy suctioned out a lot of thick
secretions.  Pulm was alos consulted to help manage his COPD.
He was treated with Solumedrol and weaned to PO steroids for his
COPD.  He was also placed on BIPAP which helped as well.  He was
transfused 1 PRBC for a HCT of 26 on [**12-22**] and given lasix.  He
was out of bed an remained in the ICU only as long as he did
mostly because of a bed issue.  On [**12-25**] [**Doctor Last Name **] was d/c'd. small
leak in remaing CT.  Remained chest tube was clamped and removed
and he was started per pulm recs on an outpt COPD regimine.  he
was transferred to the floor where he did well, worked with PT
and was discharged home in good condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken to the OR on [**4-3**] for a resection. Intraoperatively,
it was found that the tumor could not be resected without a
complete pneumonectomy therefore this was done. Post operatively
she was transferred to the PACU and then to the ICU. An epidural
was placed pre-op which provided pain relief. The Acute Pain
Service followed her throughout her hospital course. She had a
tube placed in the OR however it was removed immediately
post-op. She was transferred to the floor. PT was consulted and
she ambulated well. She had an episode of orthostatic
hypotension which resolved with fluids. Her Hct was stable
throughout her hospital stay. Serial CXR showed that her
surgical side was healing well and slowly filled with fluid. On
POD#6 she was tolerating a regular diet and her pain was
controlled with PO medications and she was deemed safe for D/C.
She was also given a course of 5 days of Levofloxacin for
peri-operative pulmonary coverage. This was completed prior to
her D/C.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 65 yo Vietnamese male with a PMH sig for Non-small cell
endobronchial lung CA s/p RMSB stent ([**5-21**]), COPD, and CRI
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**2128-7-2**] for inability to wean from a
ventilator. Pt was inititally admitted to an OSH with resp
failure secondary to pneumonia, which required intubation. He
susequently developed a Left PTX and received 2 Left sided chest
tubes. Pt was extubated on [**7-7**] and one of his CT??????s was removed
on [**7-8**]. Pt was initially noted to be confused and agitated,
which has subsequently improved once he left the MICU. A
post-pyloric NGT was successfully placed and pt was at goal tube
feeds of 40 cc/hr. Throughout his stay he noted a non-radiating
pain in his L chest over the CT. He continued to have a cough.
Pt also received a post-pyloric nasogastric tube after he failed
a swallow evaluation post extubation.  He was maintained at goal
tube feeds of 40 cc/hr until he pulled out the tube.  A repeat
swallow evaluation was normal and the patient's diet was
advanced as tolerated.

1. Respiratory Failure.  Etiology thought to be multifactorial.
Pt was successfully extubated on [**2128-7-7**] and transferred out of
the intensive care unit on [**2128-7-10**].  His O2 sats were initially
maintained on 2.5 L NC and on RA prior to discharge. Oncology
was consulted while the pt was in the intensive care unit for
his NSCLC. It was determined that he was not a surgical
candidate and radiation oncology was consulted to talk to the pt
about radiation therapy for palliation. A CT w/ contast was done
to evaluate his tumor burden. He was given IVF and mucomyst for
his CRI. Pt will follow-up with radiation oncology and oncology
as an out-patient.

2. COPD. Likely contributing to his respitory symptoms. He was
started on prednisone in the unit, which was subsequently
tapered prior to his discharge. He was continued on nebulizer
and inhaler treatments. He was also given Guaifenesin q 6 hrs
for cough.

3. PTX, thought to be secondary to barotrauma. One chest tube
was removed in the unit. Subcutaneous emphysema developed. It
sebsequently improved and the chest tube was changed from wall
suction to water seal and then to air. It continued to drain pus
and was left in place at the time of discharge as per thoracic
surgery's recommendation.  The patient and his daugher were
instructed on how to care for the tube and a follow-up
appointment was made with thoracic surgery.  They plan to remove
the tube 2 inches per week.

4. HTN. Well controlled throughout his hospital stay on ACEI and
B-B.

5. Hyponatremia.  Etiology thought to be secondary to large
amounts of free water boluses added to his tube feeds.
Hyponatremia resolved once the fluid boluses were decreased.

6. CRI. Baseline Cr reported as 1.7. Cr decreased to 1.2,
however bumped to 1.5 post contrast. He was aggressively
hydrated and his Cr improved to 1.3 on day of discharge.

7. ID. staph bacteremia- initially started on iv oxacillin which
was then changed to dicloxacillin. Pt continued to spike temps
during his stay.  Bld, Sputum, Pleural fluid, and Urine cultures
were obtained.  Blood and pleural fluid with MSSA. Urine grew
GPC in pairs and clusters.  Pt started on IV Vanco while on the
floor.

8. GI. Pt had 1 episode of melena. Etiology thought to be
gastritis or small ulcer. pt has 2 PIV's. he was consented and
crossmatched, however remained hemodynamically stable. He was on
po protonix. No EGD performed given clinical stability &
comorbities.

9. Agitation.  Noted while pt was in the unit, however appeared
to resolve once the patient was on the floor. He was initially
controlled on Haldol prn with a sitter.

10. Social.  SW consulted to help pt and family cope w/ new dx
of CA.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32289**] was admitted to the MICU service.  The cause of his
respiratory failure was somewhat unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] did not have a
post-obstructive pneumonia compared with his prior films.  There
was concern that he had obstruction of his stent, given
enlarging tumor.  The cause of his cardiac arrest was also
unclear - either his [**Name (NI) 7792**] was a cause of the arrest, or was an
effect of the hypoperfusion.  He was treated with aspirin,
statin, beta-blocker, vancomycin, and solumedrol.  At this
point, there was a family meeting held.  They agreed to extubate
him, and if he failed they wanted him to be made comfortable.
Upon extubation, he was in mild respiratory distress and was
placed on a morphine drip.  He died on [**2129-5-15**] at 12:01 am.

Service:  ONCOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 57 year old
male with non-small lung carcinoma diagnosed in [**2125-2-2**], at which time he presented with cough.  A chest x-ray
revealed a left upper lobe mass and CT scan guided biopsy
confirmed the diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma.
The patient underwent eight cycles of Taxotere Carboplatin
between [**4-14**] and [**5-5**], for which the patient reportedly had
an excellent response.

In [**2127-4-3**], the patient received XRT complicated by
esophagitis.  In [**2127-6-3**], the patient was started on weekly
Taxotere with only minimal response.  The patient underwent
pleuracentesis on [**2127-9-25**], and again on [**10-2**], for
symptomatic relief of malignant pleural effusions.

On [**2127-10-15**], the patient was started on Gemcitabine and
EGFR inhibitor.  The patient presented to clinic today for
day number eight of chemotherapy with Gemcitabine.  The
patient reports having worsening cough associated with
shortness of breath beginning three days prior to admission.
The patient had been taking codeine without relief in
symptoms.

In the Clinic, the patient's O2 saturations were recorded as
93% on four liters.  The patient was admitted for hypoxia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non-small cell lung carcinoma, metastatic.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Codeine.
2.  Robitussin DM.
3.  Fiber laxative.
4.  Sc benzoate.
5.  OSI-774.

ALLERGIES:   Intravenous contrast.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with four children.
Former child psychologist.  [**Country 3992**] war veteran.  History of
tobacco, quit in [**2100**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission febrile; pulse 136;
pressure 115/70; no pulsus paradoxus.  O2 saturation 94 on
50% shovel mask.  In general, awake, alert, tachypneic,
shallow breath.  HEENT:  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Anicteric sclerae.  Moist mucous membranes.  Cardiovascular:
regular rate; tachycardic to 136.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops appreciated.  Lungs with crackles at left base;
otherwise clear.  Dullness to percussion at left base; using
accessory muscles of respiration.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
normal bowel sounds.  Extremities with no edema.

ADMISSION LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit
of 33.9, ANC 5830.

Chest x-ray, left pleural effusion with layering on lateral
decubitus.

EKG sinus tachycardia; no changes compared to previous EKG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 57 year old male with
metastatic non-small lung carcinoma status post chemotherapy
and XRT who presents with a three day history of worsening
cough and dyspnea on exertion, with hypoxia and evidence of
increasing pleural effusion on chest x-ray.

On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable and
started on supplemental O2, morphine and Prednisone taper.
Was started intravenous fluids for sinus tachycardia was
thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.  The patient's
respiratory status continued to decline and the patient was
intubated on hospital day number three.

The patient became progressively hypotensive and was started
on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.  In addition,
the patient began spiking fevers and was started on
Ceftazidine and Vancomycin for a presumed superimposed
pleural infection.  The patient's white count and platelets
began to decrease likely secondary to Gemcitabine
chemotherapy.

A family meeting was held and given metastatic cancer, it was
decided to make the patient comfort measures only.  The
patient was started on Ativan and morphine infusions.

The patient passed away on [**2127-10-29**].

Service:  [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 78 year old male with
a complex past medical history notable for non-small cell
lung cancer, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] Thoracic Surgery Service on [**2132-5-16**], for
preoperative evaluation for a planned mediastinoscopy with a
right upper lobe resection scheduled for [**2132-5-19**].

The patient initially presented to his primary care provider
in [**2132-3-1**] with a two week history of hemoptysis.
Evaluation chest CT scan demonstrated a 3.2 centimeters right
upper lobe mass and a 2 centimeter pre-carinal lymph node.
Subsequent needle biopsy was notable for non-small cell lung
cancer.  A PET scan conducted [**2132-5-1**], demonstrated
right sided primary lung cancer with activity in the right
hilum, and no apparently involvement of other organs.  The
patient was subsequently referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] for
evaluation and thereafter scheduled for a mediastinoscopy
with a right upper lobe resection on [**2132-5-19**].  The
patient was subsequently admitted on [**2132-5-16**], for
preoperative heparinization given a past history of chronic
atrial fibrillation and a mechanical mitral valve.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Status post mechanical mitral valve replacement in [**2115**].
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
7.  Anemia.
8.  Status post left inguinal hernia repair.
9.  Osteomyelitis.
10. Osteoarthritis.
11. Questionable seizure disorder.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Digoxin 215 micrograms p.o. q. day.
3.  Dilantin 100 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Works as a school crossing guard.  Has a
greater than 40 pack year tobacco history.  Denies any
extensive history of alcohol or drug use.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2132-5-16**], the patient was admitted
to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the direction of Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] for preoperative heparinization.  The patient
was begun on a heparin drip at a rate of 1000 cc. per hour
for a target PTT of 60 to 80.  The patient was successfully
anti-coagulated without complication through [**2132-5-19**], at
which point he underwent a mediastinoscopy with a right upper
lobe resection.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and
required one unit of fresh frozen plasma and three units of
packed red blood cells interoperatively.

The patient was subsequently successfully extubated in the
Operating Room and transferred to the Recovery Room for
further evaluation and management.  On postoperative check,
the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with a 91%
oxygen saturation on a 40% face mask and a postoperative
hematocrit of 32.2.  A right sided chest tube was noted to be
in place with evidence of a small leak and moderate drainage
to low continuous wall suction.  The patient was subsequently
cleared for transfer to the floor and was admitted to the
Thoracic Surgery Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].

Postoperative pain control was provided via PCA.  While on
the floor, the patient had a protracted clinical course, but
was nonetheless noted to gradually progress well clinically.

Secondary to a persistently coarse respiratory examination,
the patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2132-5-21**], which
demonstrated old obstructing blood clots with a greater
preponderance in the right side versus the left side.  The
patient was subsequently suctioned clear of all such blood
clots and was noted to have a clean and intact right upper
lobe operative site.

The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy who continued
to follow the patient for the duration of his stay and
recommended to patient to [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation following
resolution of his acute medical issues.

The patient was restarted on his Coumadin therapy but was
shortly thereafter noted to be supra-therapeutic with an INR
of 3.1.  The patient's Coumadin was subsequently discontinued
pending resolution of his super-therapeutic status and
further investigation as to the etiology of his
hyper-sensitivity.

Following identification of his super-therapeutic status, the
patient was again noted to have transient worsening of his
respiratory examination, instigating a repeat bronchoscopy on
[**2132-5-23**].  Repeat bronchoscopy demonstrated a complete
obstruction of the right main stem, right middle lobe and
right lower lobe bronchi with blood clots and thick
secretions, which were all subsequently removed with suction.

In addition, marked extrinsic compression of the right middle
lobe and right lower lobe was noted.  The patient was
thereafter begun on aggressive chest Physical Therapy and an
aspiration work-up was begun.

Serial video swallow studies were thereafter obtained, which
initially demonstrated total intolerance of thin liquids and
marginal tolerance of soft solids and nectar thickened
liquids.

Given these results, as well as the patient's apparent
propensity for hyper-sensitivity to Coumadin therapy, it was
thought that the patient was a significant risk for
malnutrition and he was subsequently fitted with a Dobbhoff
feeding tube for direct gastric feeding.  The patient
remained n.p.o. and on tube feeds through postoperative day
number eight, during which time he was noted to exhibit
improved clinical status.

The patient was restarted on his Coumadin therapy and was
subsequently gradually titrated to a target INR of 2.5.
Repeat chest CT scan demonstrated improved aeration within
portion of the right middle and right lower lobes.  The
patient's chest tube was subsequently removed without
complications and the patient demonstrated a continued
adequate oxygen saturation on minimal supplemental O2
therapy.

Repeat video swallow and barium swallow studies conducted on
[**5-30**], demonstrated persistent but decreased aspiration of
plain liquids and adequate tolerance of soft solids and
nectar thickened liquids.  In addition, the patient was noted
to demonstrate significant esophageal spasm with associated
reflux of swallowed contents to the pyriform sinus.  Despite
these findings, it was thought that the patient would benefit
from a feeding trial and he was subsequently re-instituted on
soft solid diet and thickened nectar liquids with Boost
supplements on [**5-30**].

The patient was thereafter noted to be tolerant of this
modified diet and his tube feeds were entirely discontinued.
The patient was thereafter noted to progress well clinically
through postoperative day number 14, [**2132-6-2**], at which
point he was cleared for discharge to an extended care
facility for further evaluation and management, and was
provided instructions for follow-up.

DISPOSITION:   The patient is to be discharged to an extended
care facility with instructions for follow-up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Digoxin 250 micrograms p.o. q. day.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.

Pertinent Results:
[**2144-5-30**] chest CT scan: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. A significant interval worsening and development of new areas
of airspace opacities in the both lung fields, that likely
represent multi-focal infection, however given increase in size
of mediastinal lymph nodes, progression of malignancy remains a
possibility. Differential diagnosis also includes interstitial
edema.

3. Unchanged appearance of small left pleural effusion, and
pericardial effusion, and slight decrease in the size of the
right pleural effusion.

4. Status post thoracotomy and right upper lobe resection with
reconstruction of SVC, with stable appearance of postoperative
changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for SOB, fever, chills. CTA was done and r/o'd
out for PE, LUL, LLL opacities were seen consistant w/
infectious process. Admitted to the ICU for high oxygen
requirement and resp compromise. Pt was started on broad
spectrum IVAB- vanco, cipro, flagyl. His leukocytosis improved
and oxygen requirement decreased. He was transferred from the
ICU to the floor for ongoing management. He was seen by psych
for anxiety and depression- he was started on xanax and remeron.
He had a positive response to both these medications. Serial
CXR's, although somewhat improved on abx, continued to  reveal
overall inflammation. Given previous XRT, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended steroid course. Pt was started on 60mg
po prednisone. cxr showed little improvement after 4 days of
therapy but pt was clinically and subjectively much improved.
IVAB were d/c'd and started on 10 day course of po clinda and
levo. Oxygen requirement was weaned down to 2 liters w/ sats of
94%. Desat to 84% on roomair w/ ambulation. Pt was d/c/'d to
home w/ VNA, on home O2, oral abx and po prednisone.

4. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
5. Mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation.
6. Atrial fibrillation.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. History of rheumatic fever.

ADMITTING HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female, who was recently diagnosed with a right upper lobe
mass after being worked up for congestive heart failure.
This mass, which was initially noted on chest x-ray during
the congestive heart failure workup, was further evaluated by
CT scan which was followed by mediastinoscopy on [**2179-8-9**].  Lymph node biopsy initially did not demonstrate a new
lesions, but she presents for definitive evaluation.  Her
lymph node biopsy initially did not give a definitive proof
of malignancy.  The patient presents for definitive
evaluation of this mass.  She has not had any recent cough,
or sputum, or chest pain, or weight loss.

ADMITTING PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's temperature is
98.9, pulse 72, respiratory rate 20, with an O2 saturation of
96% on room air, blood pressure was 138/54, and her admitting
weight was 66 kg.  Otherwise, she was alert.  Neck revealed
no adenopathy.  Her lungs were both clear bilaterally.  The
heart was regular, rate, and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft and
the extremities had no edema.

ADMITTING LABORATORIES:  Hematocrit was 36.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**8-31**] on which day she underwent a right upper lobe
lobectomy with a mediastinal lymph node dissection without
note of intraoperative complication.  She had minimal blood
loss during the procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient was extubated without difficulty
and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.  Pain control was
provided by an epidural catheter which was notably placed
intrathecally.  Placement of this catheter intrathecally
required the patient to stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
on postoperative day one, but otherwise she was doing well
with incentive spirometry and aggressive chest PT.

She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day two,
where she remained afebrile and continued with chest PT and
incentive spirometry, and had her chest tubes removed.

By postoperative day three, the patient had remained
afebrile.  Otherwise, was not breathing well with good O2
saturations on room air and was ambulating without
difficulty.  Pain control was not an issue, and the patient
successfully passed her voiding trial, and was therefore
discharged to home in good condition.  Discharge hematocrit
was 32.1.

Patient was discharged to home in good condition and asked to
followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] at his office in one week and also
to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at his office in early next week.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 250 mcg po q day.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 47yo man with a history of Stage III squamous cell
cancer of lung. He underwent chemo/rads treatment, which was
completed in [**5-11**]. He presents for resection of his primary
tumor.

Past Medical History:
1. Stage 3 lung cancer as well as a separate Stage 1 lesion,
status post incomplete round of [**Doctor Last Name **]-Taxol and is currently
undergoing radiation therapy.
2. Interstitial nephritis secondary to Lithium toxicity.  His
chronic renal failure is currently stable.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of seizures on Clozaril.
5. Question of hypothyroidism.
6. Head injury in [**2077**] with a loss of consciousness.

Past psychiatric history:
The patient has had multiple past inpatient admissions beginning
during his senior year of high school. His last hospitalization
was at [**Hospital1 **] 4 prior to being transferred to the medical
service for hypotension. Outside records indicate that prior to
that the most recent hospitalization was at the [**Hospital3 13347**] for one and a half months from [**Month (only) 404**] to [**Month (only) 958**] of this
year. He has one past suicide attempt by wrist cutting in [**2065**]
and said that this was because his father died. Outside records
indicate that he also had a suicide attempt by jumping off a
bridge in the remote past (?[**2077**]). He has been on a variety of
antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing agents in the past and has
had at least two sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. He did
extremely well on Clozaril between [**2099**] and [**2102-5-7**] until
it had to be stopped because of seizures.

Substance Abuse history:
Records indicate that pt has a history of drug abuse including
heroin but pt has refused to talk about it further. Pt has a
tobacco history and reports that prior to admission he smoked
one to four cigarettes per day.


Social History:
He has mother and brother who live together with whom he has
close contacts. The patient reports that his father died of a
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in [**2065**]. Currently he is
unemployed. He did complete some college, his closest supports
are his family and staff members at his group home. Please also
see Dr.[**Name (NI) 54684**] discharge summary of [**2103-5-31**] for more
information. Difficult to elicit specific smoking or alcohol
history

Family History:
Maternal grandfather with alcohol abuse, he denies a family
history of mental illness or suicide. Family history otherwise
non-contrbutory.

Physical Exam:
Physical exam on admission:
VS: 97.7  77  155/92  97%RA
CV: RRR
Pulm: decreased BS on L, otherwise clear
Abd: Soft, non-tender
Ext: WArm, well-perfused.

Pertinent Results:
MRSA positive on [**2103-10-31**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt had very long, complicated hospital course. Admitted on
[**2103-9-20**] for left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection. Tolerated procedure well. Admitted to SICU post-op
for close respiratory monitoring, and close follow of
electrolytes secondary to chronic renal insufficiency from
lithium toxicity.

Neuro: Sedated and ventilated for much of SICU course. As pt was
extubated and gradually weaned off sedation, his psych
comorbidities emerged as a greater problem, and he eventually
needed a 1:1 sitter for behavioral safety. With the assistance
of the psychiatry service, pt was eventually returned to his
home regimen of psychiatric medications with appropriate
behavior and responses.

Resp: Tracheostomy placed [**9-24**] in anticipation of long-term
ventilation, with eventual decannulation as longer-term plan. Pt
frequently had thick, heavy secretions requiring bronchoscopic
cleanout several times. Eventually pt was better able to handle
his own secretions and could maintain near-normal saturations
with only intermittent suctioning by nursing staff.

FEN/GI: Nutritionally maintained through dobhoff feeds with
Promote feed. Eventually a PEG tube was placed as it was
anticipated pt would have poor swallow status, and would need
nutrition to recover appropriately from surgery. Due to his CRI,
his creatinine was closely monitored, and near the end of his
hospital stay he was changed to Nepro formula (from Promote) as
his K and Cr continued to rise. Pt at goal calories. Pt failed 2
video swallow evals, although on the second he showed
considerable improvement. It is likely that, as his mental
status continues to improve, his ability to coordinate swallow
instructions from therapists will further improve his swallow.

ID: Pt found to be MRSA positive by swab culture on [**10-31**], and
maintained on appropriate precautions. Treated with Zosyn on
course suggested by ID.

History of Present Illness:
71F with a history of hypertension, anxiety, abnormal LFTs,
macular degeneration, GERD,fibroid uterus, urinary incontinence,
hyperlipidemia, and pancreatitis who is admitted today following
a newly diagnosed RLL lung mass.  She was recently discharged
form the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2168-11-10**] after presenting with 1 day of
blood-streaked sputum, mild dyspnea and wheezing in the setting
of 6 months of a non-productive cough.  At that time, she denied
chest pain or syncope.  A CXR at that time showed a RML
pneumonia with a new ill-defined opacity noted overlying on of
the mid-thoracic vertebral bodies.  She was sent home with ten
days of levofloxacin 500mg po daily for the pneumonia.  In
follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she noted no further
hemoptysis and an improvement in her mild dyspnea and wheezing.
A repeat CXR on [**11-30**] showed a persistent infiltrate/atelectasis
in the RML; it also showed a mass-like enlarged right hilum and
a new 8-mm nodular density projecting over the left lung apex.
Her PCP started her empirically on 10 days of
amoxicillin/clavulanate at this time and scheduled a chest CT.
.
The CT on [**12-7**] showed bulky mediastinal adenopathy with
collapse of the right middle bronchus, occlusion of the right
superior pulmonary vein, encasement/constriction of the right
main pulmonary artery and inferior pulmonary veins,
displacement/deformation of the left atrium, and
narrowing/invasion of the superior vena cava.  It noted a 3.5 x
3cm mass in the right lower lobe, presumed to be the primary
tumor.  A 7mm apical nodule was deemed consistent with a
granuloma.  No pleural or pericardial effusions were seen.  Both
adrenals were noted to be enlarged.  The liver was noted to
likely be cirrhotic along with intraabdominal ascites.  Of note,
a CXR on [**2167-9-15**] was normal.
.
Her PCP sent her to the ED for expedited workup and management.
In the ED, her vitals were T 96.9, HR 90, BP 150/90, RR 16, Sat
99% on room air.  Her exam was notable for wheezes in the right
lung field.  She received 40 mEq of PO KCl due to a level of 2.3
and was put on telemetry.
.
ROS: Reports one week of excessive fatigue.  Reports normal
appetite and [**3-19**] lbs weight gain over past several weeks.
Reports mild increase in abdominal girth.  Denies changes in
urinary or bowel habits.  Denies any recent fevers, cough,
dyspnea, or wheezing over the psat 3 weeks.  Reports chronic,
worsening vision loss.  Denies headaches.  She denies any recent
chest pain, pedal edema, exertional or rest dyspnea.

Skin: ?mild hyperpigmentation, no rashes/lesions

Pertinent Results:
CT Chest ([**12-7**]): The hilar component of a 6 x 5cm, mass
involving the right hilus and middle mediastinum, obstructs the
right middle lobe bronchus, producing collapse of the RML,
significantly narrows the upper lobe bronchus and protrudes into
the bronchus intermedius, narrowing it as well. Proximally,
endobronchial tumor extends to 1 cm from the carina. The mass
occludes the right superior pulmonary vein and encases and
constricts the right main pulmonary artery and inferior
pulmonary veins. It displaces and deforms the left atrium,
obliterating adjacent fat planes; no pericardial effusion is
present. Mediastinal tumor in the right paratracheal station
from the right upper lobe bronchus to the level of the aortic
arch, up to 4.5cm in diameter, severely narrows and invades the
superior vena cava. Subcarinal adenopathy measures 3 x 4 cm. A
3.5 x 3 cm mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe
is most likely the primary lung cancer. A 7mm left apical nodule
is most likely a granuloma.  Mild emphysema is predominantly
apical. The pleural surfaces are smooth and there is no pleural
effusion.  Both adrenals are enlarged, the left 6.0 x 2.6 cm,
the right 4.7 x 2.0 cm. Ascites is present and the lobulated
liver margins, irregularity and heterogeneity of the liver
suggest cirrhosis. Hypodense renal lesions are likely cortical
cysts. There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
.
CT head ([**12-8**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.
ECG ([**12-8**]): sinus rhythm at 101 bpm, normal axis, normal
intervals, ST depression in II, V2-V5, no Q waves, no ST
elevations


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt's chest CT was concerning for malignancy.  Pt was seen by
Interventional Pulm who placed a stent in her RML bronchus
~[**12-8**] and obtained a biopsy which revealed small cell
carcrinoma.  She was started on pip/taz and vanco for
post-obstructuve PNA.  She continued to have hypokalemia and
hyperglycemia causing concern for an ACTH secreting
paraneoplastic syndrome.  She was the transfered to the oncology
service on [**2168-12-10**] for initiation of chemotherapy.  She
received 3 doses of carboplatin and etoposide on [**11-9**],
and [**12-14**].
.
Pt was transfused 2 Units of PRBC's on [**12-13**] with an increase in
her HCT from 23 to 25 (HCT 40 on admission).  She was therefore
given an additional 2 Units [**12-14**].  On [**12-15**] at 6AM she was noted
to have diarrhea with blood.  HCT was again 23.  She was
transfused 1 Unit of PRBC's with an appropriate increase to 27.
She remained stable until the evening of [**12-15**] when she dropped
to 23.   She received 2 Units and bumped to 30.  Her HCT
decreased from 30 to 20 over the next 24 hrs.  She is now being
transfused 2 Units.  Of note on [**11-30**] she underwent an EGD
notable for mild gastritis and a C-scope notable for several
adenomatous polyps.  She had a RBC scan which was unremarkable
on [**12-15**].  NG lavage clear but was without bile.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:
# GIB:
Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**12-17**] for repeat EGD in the
setting of GIB.  At the time she denied CP/SOB/N/hematemesis/abd
pain/fever/chills.  +appetite.  Repeat EGD was unremarkable for
source of acute bleeding.  As such, lower GI source was
suspected, given recent polypectomy on [**11-30**].  However, pt's
diarrhea contained only modest melena/red streaks.  As such, GI
deferred colonoscopy on [**12-18**].  Pt is also s/p recent negative
tagged rbc scan on [**12-14**].  Hemolysis labs were obtained on [**12-18**]
which was unremarkable.  Pt's WBC was <0.5 raising concern for
neutropenia, thus GI deferred colonoscopy again on [**12-19**].  Given
pt was otherwise hemodynamically stable, decision was made to
start neupogen on [**12-20**] and await WBC>=1.0 before proceeding with
colonoscopy.  Pt was called out to floor on [**12-21**] as her hct had
been stable for ~24-36hrs, to await colonoscopy.
.
Pt continued to require multiple transfusions to maintain HCT >
25, suggesting ongoing bleeding, thus she remained in the ICU
and received an additional unit of PRBC on [**12-18**] and [**12-19**], in
addition to 1 bag platelets.   Her atenolol was held in the
setting of GIB.  CT abdomen on [**12-19**] was negative for RP bleed.
Given ongoing bleeding, and decsision to defer colonscopy, pt
underwent nuclear scan on [**2169-12-22**] which showed ?focus of
abnormal activity on RLQ.  pt was then discussed with IR, with
plan for angiography +/- embolization if possible, however
tagged rbc scan was negative.  pt was also evaluated by surgical
service with regard to operative management of lower GIB, with
decision to defer surgical intervention given lack of definitive
source of bleeding.  On [**12-23**] decision was made to pursue
colonoscopy given ongoing active bloody stools without obvious
source of bleeding, which showed apparent several cm long region
of infiltrating tumor ~60cm from anus, c/w  infiltrative folds,
with a single very large ulcer was seen in the colon at the area
of infiltrated-appearing folds at 60cm from the anus, suggestive
of either metastatic disease vs primary colon cancer.
.
.
given the above findings, family meeting was held with oncology
service, and goals of care were changed to comfort only.  pt was
extubated, later that evening, and expired shortly thereafter at
4:55PM on [**2168-12-23**].
.
.
#  Metastatic ACTH-secreting small cell lung CA:
Pt has mets to liver and adrenals.  MRI Head negative for mets.
She is s/p [**4-15**] doses of chemo on [**12-14**].  Chemo was likley
contributing to pancytopenia.   Vanco/Zosyn were started on
admission empirically for post-obstructive pneumonia, however
these were d/c'd on [**12-18**] as pt was without fever, wbc, or sputum
production.  On [**12-21**] pt was noted to have fever to 100.4.  Given
her neutropenia, cultures were obtained, and pt started on
cefipime/vanco (day 1 [**12-21**]).  her most recent chemo was dose 3/3
of [**Doctor Last Name **]/Etoposide ([**Date range (1) **]).  Rad/onc initially had plans
XRT post chemo, which were to be deferred until resolution of
GIB.
.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - was felt likely secondary to chemo and
dilution from 10+ units of PRBC's.  Per GI plan was to transfuse
platelets to keep plt > 50 as this could be contributing to
ongoing active bleeding.
.
.
# Hypokalemia/Hypernatremia - most likely secondary to
ACTH-secreting SCLC (cortisol 167).  Spirinolactone was
continued as pt's SBPs remained stable throughout her GIB
episode.  Her potassium was aggresively repleted.  Her Na
remained within normal limits once pt was encouraged to maintain
PO hydration.   Pt continued to have [**Hospital1 **] lytes and active
repletion of K.   She was also continued on spironalactone
(started [**12-9**]), at 50mg qdaily.
.
.
# Hyperglycemia - likely related to ACTH secretion from lung
cancer, pt was continued on RISS.  In addition, she was started
on glypizide on [**12-21**] given her likelihood of continuing to have
elevated FSBS [**3-17**] ACTH secretion.
.
.
# Hypertension: BP well controlled despite holding atenolol for
active GIB.  We have tolerated SBPs 150s-160s in the setting of
gi bleeding.
.
.
# ARF (baseline 1.2-1.3) thought to be prerenal azotemia; Creat
subsequently trended down to 1.0.  Elevated BUN may be secondary
to hypovolemia from GI bleed.  Good UOP after foley placement
(pt was incontinent x 3 [**12-17**]), and creatinine remained at
baseline throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.
.
.
# Ascites/?cirrhosis: LFTs mildly elevated likely related to
metastatic diasese to liver, and per daughter ascites on [**12-18**]
was better than baseline obese habitus.  no dullness to
percussion on exam throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, and LFTs
unremarkable. pt was continued on spirinolactone for
hyperaldosterone state as above.
.
.
# Anxiety.  Pt had episode of delirium thought to be secondary
to high dose ativan.  She remained anxious on [**12-17**], but A&Ox3.
As such, low dose ativan 0.5 mg IV prn was used.  On [**12-21**] AM pt
was notable agitated/irritated.  She ""wants to get out of the
ICU!"".  Did not feel this represent delirium as pt was A&Ox3 and
able to focus appropriately.  Did not feel ativan was
contributing given she has been receiving this throughout
hospital course in low-dose form.  No intervention was felt
necessary, and pt was subsequently intubated and sedated for
colonoscopy.
.
.
# COPD: pt continued on Albuterol/Atrovent nebs.  Will hold
tiotropium while hospitalized
.
# FEN:  On [**12-18**] pt advanced to clears with jello after negative
EGD.  As she was awaiting colonoscopy, plan is to advance diet
to regulars until WBC > 0.5-1.0 before re-prepping. however on
[**12-22**] pt was prepped for colonoscopy and remained NPO until she
expired.
.
.
# PPX:  No heparin given compromise of great vessels by tumor;
pneumoboots, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
.
# dispo - pt expired on [**12-23**] after goals of care changed to CMO
during family meeting.

Date of Birth:  [**2135-5-14**]        Sex:  F

Service:  MED


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
female with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2188**], status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy including
prophylactic whole brain irradiation and stem cell rescue,
also with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on home oxygen and recurrent right sided pleural effusion who
presented to the clinic on the day of admission with
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was sent to the
emergency department from the clinic where she was found to
be saturating in the 90s on 100 percent nonrebreathing.  A
right sided thoracentesis was done with removal of 600 cc of
serous fluid which initially improved the patient's oxygen
saturation.  However, the patient subsequently desaturated
again on the nonrebreather requiring intubation.  The
patient's daughter reported that she has had increased
agitation and somnolence as well as green/[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum over
the past seven days.  She had been started on levofloxacin
without significant improvement in the sputum production.  On
the day prior to admission she developed increased somnolence
and lethargy prompting her visit to clinic.  She received
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2188**], status post radiation, chemotherapy, stem cell rescue,
prophylactic brain radiation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Hypothyroidism.

Atypical pneumonia.

Recurrent right pleural effusion.

Mental status changes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been married for 38 years.
Her daughter is a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 188**].  She is a former smoker and quit 70 pack years.  She
quit in [**2188**].  She denies any alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Is significant for mother diabetes and
father with hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Synthroid 100 mcg q.d., Celebrex,
Serevent, Atrovent, albuterol, home oxygen, levofloxacin 500
mg q.d.  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 98, blood
pressure 127/63, heart rate 126, respiratory rate 22,
saturating 90 percent on 100 percent non-rebreather.  In
general this is an ill appearing woman in respiratory
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:
Mucous membranes slightly dry, extraocular movements intact.
Jugular venous distension was 6 cm.  Cardiac examination:
Tachycardic with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Lung examination:  Coarse breath sounds throughout
with decreased breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Neurologically alert and responsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission:  CBC revealed a white count
of 15.6 with 81 percent neutrophils, hematocrit was 39.1,
platelet count 321.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 137 with
potassium of 5.9, chloride of 93, bicarbonate of 38, BUN of
18, creatinine of 0.4 and glucose of 106.  Pleural fluid
showed 1335 white blood cells and [**Pager number 6326**] red blood cells.
Total protein was 4.1, glucose was 111 and albumin was 1.1.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 132 with normal
axis and normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  There were no ST or T wave
changes.  There were Q waves in 3 and AVF.  Chest x-ray
showed a large right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
collapse.  Her endotracheal tube was in place.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated in the
   emergency department.  Her respiratory failure was felt to
   be multifactorial with the pleural effusion and sizable
   lobar collapse playing a large role.  She was also treated
   for possible pneumonia and had bronchoscopy with BAL done
   on both [**5-10**] and [**5-11**].  BAL grew pansensitive pseudomonas
   and she was treated for this initially with ceftriaxone
   and azithromycin and then subsequently with ceftazidime to
   complete a 14 day course.  Given her underlying lung
   disease including bronchiectasis and severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, it was felt that she would
   likely have a long wean off the ventilator.  She therefore
   underwent tracheostomy on [**5-15**].  She was initially
   maintained on pressure controlled ventilation and was
   eventually able to be weaned from pressure support mode.
   She is currently tolerating 10 of pressure support with 5
   of PEEP and an FIO2 of 0.4.  On those settings she is
   pulling tidal volumes in the 300s and saturating 96 to 98
   percent.  We did consider chest tube placement to treat
   her effusion.  However, the patient was oxygenating and
   ventilating well and this was therefore deferred.

1. Pneumonia:  As stated above patient was felt to likely
   have an underlying pneumonia as the source of her acute
   decompensation.  She was treated with ceftazidine for
   pseudomonas pneumonia and will complete a 14 day course.
   She also received chest physical therapy and suctioning
   p.r.n.

1. Small cell lung cancer:  Cytology from both her BAL and
   from her pleural fluid were negative for malignant cells.
   At this time there is no evidence of disease recurrence.

1. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on her home
   dose of Synthroid.  Given her persistent tachycardia a TSH
   and free T4 were checked and are pending at the time of
   this dictation.

1. Tachycardia:  The patient was persistently tachycardic
   throughout her admission.  This was initially felt to be
   secondary to volume depletion.  However, this did not
   resolve with intravenous fluids.  She underwent an
   echocardiogram which showed depressed left ventricular
   ejection fraction and was started on an ACE inhibitor for
   afterload reduction.  As mentioned above thyroid function
   tests were also checked given her history of
   hypothyroidism and are currently pending.

1. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had a
   Dobhoff tube placed and has been on tube feeds since
   admission.  A speech and swallow evaluation is pending.

1. Metabolic alkalosis:  This is felt to be compensatory for
   the patient's primary respiratory acidosis from her
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  A urine chloride
   was checked and was 112 suggesting that her metabolic
   alkalosis was not chloride responsive.

1. Access:  Patient had a right subclavian vein and right
   radial arterial line which were both discontinued prior to
   discharge.  A PICC line was placed by Interventional
   Radiology.

1. Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
   heparin, Venodynes and proton pump inhibitor.

1. Hyperglycemia:  The patient was on an insulin sliding
   scale with good glycemic control throughout her admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
83M with multiple comorbidities presents with FDG negative RML
nodule.  Pt underwent VATS to establish tissue diagnosis.
Preliminary report of frozen sections showed likely hamartoma.
Mass was then completely enucleated.  Post-op CXR showed small
right apical pneumothorax.
Shortly after, his course was complicated by respiratory failure
and patient was re-intubated.  CXR showed R enlarged basilar
pneumothorax with the right chest tube external to the pleural
space.  The chest tube was repositioned and POD1 CXR showed
resolution of the R basilar ptx and pt was subsequently
extubated.
On POD2, pt had bradycardic respiratory arrest on the floor.
Code called, ACLS initiated with chest compression, epi and
atropine x2.  ABG revealed hypercapnea with a pCO2 of 130 and pH
of 7.00.  Pt was reintubated, narrow complex returned with
return of BP, and ppt was transferred to the TSICU.  CXR showed
no evidence of ptx.  Head CT showed no evidence of acute
intracranial process.  Neurology was consulted and recommended
head MRI to assess for evidence of hypoxic/ischemic injury.
This was negative.
Pt also underwent central line change with new stick.  Post-line
CXR showed new large right PTX.  A new right 24F chest tube was
placed, and the previous [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pleural drain was removed.
Post tube CXR showed persistent large R PTX extending to the
apex.  Chest tube was continued to suction and patient was
stable respiratory-wise.
Pt was also febrile and started empirically on vanc and zosyn.
Mental status returned to [**Location 213**] and pt was following commands.
Over the next few days, pt was stable on tube feeds and
antibiotics.  Pt did not tolerate vent wean (RSBI 177).  He
received 2 units of pRBC and lasix for Hct of 22.8.  Over this
time he developed marked muscle weakness.  Per neuro, pt was
exhibiting signs of myopthay vs degenerative muscle dz.  EMG by
neurology showed electrophysiologic evidence for a severe,
generalized sensorimotor polyneuropathy and as well as an a
superimposed myopathy.  neuromuscular junction disorders cannot
be entirely excluded.  They also recommended LP with was
negative.  BAL cx grew yeast and pt was started on fluconazole.
He continued to fail vent wean and a trach and PEG were
discussed and planned with family.  Serial CXR showed persistent
PTX, but stable.
Physical Therapy- consult for evaluation [**2136-3-11**].
Trach and PEG were placed [**2136-3-12**].  Zosyn was dc'ed for negative
cx.  post-operatively pt was doing well and R PTX was resolving.
 It was noted that his sodium was also slowly increasing.  free
water boluses were initiated and tube feeds changed from
respolar.  Pt continued to not tolerate CPAP trials.  It was
decided that pt to go to vent rehab.  on [**3-14**] chest tube was
removed and post-pull CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.

Date of Birth:   [**2112-12-25**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lung cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
female who is status post right middle lobectomy in [**2172-9-21**] for a T1 N0 M0 lung cancer and who is status post a
right upper lobe wedge resection of a mass found on
subsequent followup.  She was recently discharged on [**2177-4-23**] after that procedure.

In the interim, the patient has done well and returns to [**Hospital1 1444**] for formal right upper
lobectomy for the diagnosed undifferentiated large cell-type
lung carcinoma.  Of note, the wedge resection and lymph node
biopsies were significant for no positive lymph nodes at the
previous wedge resection.

Previous workup for this mass had provided no evidence of
metastasis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer in [**2172**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post hemiarthroplasty for displaced right femoral
neck fracture.
2.  Status post right middle lobectomy in [**2172**].
3.  Status post sinus surgery.
4.  Status post right upper lobe wedge resection in [**2177-4-21**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
Prempro 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history significant for smoking
greater than 30 years of one pack per day.  Occasional
ethanol use.  She is married with two children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had a
temperature of 98, pulse of 78, blood pressure of 120/66,
respiratory rate of 18, 98% on room air.  She was awake,
alert and oriented times three.  She had no cervical
lymphadenopathy.  Her chest was clear bilaterally, and she
had a regular rate and rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft and
nontender.  Her incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  She
had no peripheral edema or clubbing.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray prior to surgery showed no
evidence of pneumothorax or infiltrate.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
prior to admission included a white blood cell count of 5.6,
hematocrit of 39.7, a platelet count of 228.  Blood urea
nitrogen of 12.  ALT of 18 and AST of 21.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission the patient went to
the operating room where she underwent right thoracotomy a
right video-assisted thoracoscopy, and a multiple wedge
resection of the right upper lobe.  She also underwent
mediastinoscopy with lymph node dissection.

Findings in the operating room included multiple adhesions to
the chest wall, and a thickened area on the previous line,
and negative metastatic disease on frozen section.  She
tolerated this procedure well.  She had 1400 cc in
crystalloid, and a 250-cc blood loss, and made a urine output
of 380 cc.  She was extubated and sent to the Postanesthesia
Care Unit in stable condition.

Postoperatively, the patient has remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable.  Her chest tube output has decreased
appropriately and has produced serosanguineous drainage.  A
persistent air leak has remained throughout her admission.
Her postoperative chest x-ray was significant for a residual
pneumothorax which has remained stable throughout her
postoperative recovery.  The patient has been ambulating and
tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had epidural managed
by the Acute Pain Service for the first four postoperative
days and was changed to p.o. pain medication which was
tolerating.  Pathology was still pending.

Of note, the patient had a positive urine culture which was
greater than 100,000 gram-negative rods.  The patient was to
be sent home on a 5-day course of levofloxacin.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Due to the persistent air leak, a
Heimlich valve was placed on the chest tube, and the patient
was stable for discharge with chest tube and Heimlich valve
in place.  She was to go home with [**Hospital6 407**]
nursing to help care for the wound.   The patient was to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2177-5-19**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right lung adenocarcinoma, status post right upper
lobectomy.
2.  Urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications on discharge
included)
1.  Vicodin 5/500 one to two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times two more days (for a
total of five days).

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2177-5-19**] for chest tube removal.

Brief Hospital Course:
64M with a large, cavitary RLL squamous cell ca transferred with
hemoptysis, weakness and fatigue.  On arrival he had fever of
103.3 and was started empirically on vanc and zosyn for
presumptive post-obstructive pneumonia.  On HD2 pt underwent
rigid bronchoscopy with airway biopsies which showed no evidence
of tumor (only inflammation) at the hilum.  He was subsequently
worked up for possible resection of R lung.  Despite vanc and
zosyn for pneumonia, pt continued to spike fevers, but all
cultures were negative.  He had no episodes of hemoptysis during
his hospital stay.  PFT's and quantitative V/Q scan suggest 75%
of function remains in left lung, which implies adequate reserve
to tolerate resection and pneumonectomy.  ECHO was negative for
mitral or aortic valve vegetations.  Pt was also complaining of
dysphagia.  UGI showed a 2mm left-sided esophageal diverticulum
seen approximately at C6 level, but
no obstruction or stricture.  He was explained the risks,
benefits, and alternatives to surgery (particularly, his
increased risk of death given recent chemotx/radiation/active
infection), and it was decided to proceed with the operation.
On [**2140-3-8**], pt underwent laparotomy with harvesting of omental
flap and repair of umbilical hernia, right thoracotomy with
intrapericardial pneumonectomy,
radical mediastinal lymphadenectomy and omental flap
bronchoplasty (see operative report for details).  Pt was
extubated in the operating room and transferred to the CSRU for
ICU monitoring.
[**Name (NI) **], pt was requiring neo for hypotension.  His
pain was controlled with epidural and PCA.  His intake (IV and
PO) was initally limited to 1L/day given his reduced lung
volume.  As expected, his Cr rose secondary to acute pre-renal
failure.  Nephrology was consulted to assist in management of
his ARF.  Vanc levels were checked daily and dosed as needed.
Renal US was negative for hydronephrosis.  His urine output
continued to be adequate.  On POD1, the chest tube was removed
and post-pull CXR was negative for PTX.  On POD3 pt was doing
well and transferred to the floor.  The remainder of his
hospital course was uneventful.  His diet was advanced to
regular pureed, although he was having difficulties taking in
POs secondary to his dysphagia.  PT and OT evaluated and cleared
him for discharge home.  His epidural and foley were removed and
pain controlled with PO analgesia.  His antibiotics were
continued 10d post-op and were completed [**2140-3-18**].
Disposition planning initiated and coordinated w/ case
management, social work, thoracic surgery/team NP, physical
therapy.

By POD 10 pt was stable and discharged home in stable condition
with VNA services, evaluation of home services, specifically
physical therapy. Pt has some local supports in addition to VNA
services.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 44143**] is a gentleman who is
suffering from micrometastatic esophageal cancer with
dysphagia.  He had undergone test treatment with
chemotherapy, but instead chose to undergo
esophagogastrectomy for failure to relieve his progressive
dysphagia.  Micrometastases were seen by PET scan.

EXAMINATION:  The patient is a thin male in no apparent
distress.  Cervical examination reveals no adenopathy.  Eye
examination reveals the sclerae are anicteric.  Lungs are
clear.  Heart is regular without murmur.  Thorax shows no
asymmetry or lesions.  Abdomen is without mass.  The
extremities have no edema.  He does have clubbing, but states
that this has been present throughout his life.  Skin shows
no lesions or cyanosis.  Neurologically is grossly nonfocal
and intact and appropriate mental status.

LABORATORY:  On admission, the patient's white count was 10.7
with a hematocrit of 36, PT 13.1, PTT 20.3, platelets 174,
INR 1.1.  BUN and creatinine were 14 and 1.2, respectively.
At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 11.7,
with a hematocrit of 33.0, platelet count 208.  His BUN and
creatinine were 28 and 1.0, respectively.  Otherwise, his
electrolytes were normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**6-13**] and
underwent an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.  He was taken to
the Cardiothoracic Surgical Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively where he remained intubated and sedated.  He
was started on enteral nutrition with tube feeds, and was
also on inotropes in the ICU.  He did develop a pneumonia
which was treated with antibiotics, and upon resolution the
patient was transferred to the regular floor where he did
well.  The only notable problem was a few episodes of
agitation which were relieved by change in patient's
medication regimen.

In terms of procedures, the patient underwent percutaneous
tracheostomy, [**Doctor Last Name 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy, feeding
jejunostomy, and bronchoscopy.  He was in good condition at
the time of discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  1) Esophageal cancer, status post
esophagogastrectomy.  2) Pneumonia.  3) Intermittent atrial
fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia.  4) Status post

Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 48340**] is a 41-year-old
male transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with hemoptysis
in the setting of large cell lung cancer invading into his
airway.  At [**Hospital6 **], the patient had presented
on the [**6-17**] with sudden shortness of breath and
hemoptysis.  He just had radiation treatment that day.  He
had decreasing O2 saturations and chest x-ray showing right
upper lobe cavitary lesion with surrounding opacification.
The patient was intubated.  At the [**Hospital6 **]
Intensive Care Unit, the patient ran temperatures up to 101
and white count up to 23.  He was treated with levofloxacin
and Flagyl for postobstructive pneumonia.  The patient also
had a hematocrit drop from 32 to 23 and was transfused packed
red blood cells and fluid resuscitated.  Bronchoscopy at
[**Hospital6 **] showed the right main stem mass
extending into the trachea with large clot distally.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for repeat bronchoscopy and stent placements.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. PPD positive from [**2148**], however, he has had negative
acid-fast smears presumably secondary to a vaccination in
Europe.
2. Large cell lung cancer presented in [**2152-2-9**] with
hemoptysis.
3. XRT and chemotherapy.
4. The patient has metastasis to the left humerus based on
previous bone scan.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Versed drip.
2. Morphine prn.
3. Fentanyl drip.
4. Levofloxacin.
5. Flagyl.

7. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is not married.  Lives with his
brother and kids, although recently is living on his own.  He
is a smoker since the [**2129**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  He came to the US from Poland in [**2147**].

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, blood
pressure 112/66, heart rate 101, respiratory rate 25, pulse
oximetry is 100%.  The patient was sedated in no apparent
distress.  The pupils are constricted and reactive
bilaterally.  Bilateral breath sounds anteriorly with rhonchi
invented sounds.  Cardiac regular, rate, and rhythm,
tachycardic, no murmur.  Abdomen is positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  He is guaiac negative per
[**Hospital6 **] Emergency Department.  Extremities:
The patient was moving all extremities and no edema.
Multiple dark brown 1 cm round lesions were noted on his
anterior legs and right shoulder.  Neurologic examination is
nonfocal.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium of 138, potassium 4.1,
chloride 105, bicarb 21, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, and glucose
96.  White count was 12.1, hematocrit 25.8, platelet count of
394.  Coags were normal.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient was in sinus rhythm with a
tachycardia, no acute ST changes.

The patient was maintained in the MICU on the ventilator with
Fentanyl and Versed sedation.  He was stable status post
transfer.  The patient then underwent high resolution lung CT
scan and airway tracheal CT scan prior to Interventional
Pulmonology procedure.  On Monday, the [**2-20**], the
patient was taken to the operating room by the Interventional
Pulmonary team, his larynx was examined to be within normal
limits.  Tumor tissue was visualized in the distal trachea on
the right lateral wall with narrowing of the lumen to about
50%.  No endobronchial lesions in the left lung airway were
noted.  There was extensive tumor tissue in the right lung
airways with narrowing of the lumen to 20-30%.  A cavitary
lumen opens into the right mainstem bronchus.  A dynamic
Y-stent [**62**] mm in size was placed in the distal trachea during
the procedure of less than 50 mL of blood were lost.

The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.
The evening following the procedure, the patient was
extubated without any difficulty.  The patient had no
complications overnight and on Tuesday, [**2-21**], the
patient was stable.  His family was present and talking with
the patient.  He did complain of some anxiety and was given
some Ativan.  The patient is to be transferred back to [**Hospital6 11241**] for definitive home care and further
oncological treatments.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for stenting of right mainstem bronchus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy with bronchial stent removal.

History of Present Illness:
80 yo man w/ h/o Stage 3B lung cancer (s/p chemo, XRT, and stent
placement [**5-12**]), COPD on home O2, CAD (multivessel disease and
80% LM stenosis), A fib, and LLE DVT who presents from OSH with
obstructed right sided bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonia
for possible stenting.  On [**6-28**] the patient underwent
bronchoscopy which showed tumor occluding the stent which was
partially removed.  After this procedure, the patient went into
respiratory distress in the PACU and required intubation.  He
was also noted to have ST elevations on EKG in leads V2 and V3.
STAT echo revealed EF of 25%, decreased from 60% in [**2115-5-8**].
The patient was admitted to the MICU at the OSH for further
management.
.
On transfer to the MICU, the patient was hypotensive to the 70's
systolic which responded to IV fluid bolus.  Cardiology was
consulted regarding his ST elevations and recommended medical
management with addition of plavix for his left main disease.
Eventually, the patient was also started on low dose metoprolol
and captopril after his blood pressure stabilized.  The
following morning, his ST elevations had normalized.
Cardiology felt that his previous changes were due to myocardial
stunning.  During his OSH MICU course, he was also found to have
focal neuro deficits (left ptosis, left facial droop) so a head
CT was done.  This study revealed an old right parietal infarct
with moderate chronic small vessel infarcts without evidence of
enhancing lesions.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of
his right sided bronchial occlusion.  He was hemodynamically
stable on arrival, and denied CP, SOB, abdominal pain, headache,
or dizziness.

CXR was done showing complete whiteout of the right lung [**1-9**] to
post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was started on Vanco and Zosyn
for treatment of pneumonia.  Chest CT the following day revealed
bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), complete RUL/RML/RLL collapse
with apparent obstruction of the bronchial stent within the
right main stem bronchus.

Past Medical History:
- Stage 3B Lung Cancer: dx [**2114-10-8**]; s/p 8 courses of
chemo; s/p XRT; s/p stent in right bronchus [**5-12**]; s/p 5

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt bronched [**7-3**], showing right main bronchus stent frayed at
distal end, blocking RUL and with thick secretions distally.
Left bronchus was patent. Overnight [**7-3**], patient was was
hypotensive; did not respond to IVF bolus and PRBCs.  Low dose
Dopamine started with improvement of BP.  ~20 min after dopamine
started, patient went into RVR.  Dopamine stopped.  Amiodarone
started, patient still tachycardic and hypotensive.  At this
point, patient underwent synchronized cardioversion (200 and
then 300 joules), did not convert to NSR, but rate became more
controlled in low 100's.  Levophed started for BP control,
subsequently weaned off [**7-4**], converted to NS on amiodarone
drip.

Pt never weaned off mechanical ventilation through his hospital
course.  Spontaneous breathing trials were poorly tolerated.  In
addition, his cardiovascular function was tenuous.  He had acute
drop in blood pressure with cardiac enzyme leak on [**7-11**] and
throughout his course remained intermittently hypotensive and
also bradycardic at times.  Per family request pressor were not
given.  It became clear given the patients invasive lung cancer
and severe coronary artery disease that the prognosis was
extremely poor.   On [**2115-7-12**] a family meeting was held.  The
outcome of this was that pt would remain intubated but would
also still be DNR and would be given no escalation in care
including pressors or antiarrhythmics.  The family asked whether
it would be possible to send pt home on ventilator so that he
may spend his last days at home.  Such arrangements were made
but required that the patient undergo tracheostomy.
Unfortunately the patient was never sufficiently hemodynamically
stable that this procedure could safely be performed.

On [**2115-7-19**] another family meeting was held.  It was explained
that tracheostomy was not possible to perform safely and that
the patient would probably spend the remainder of his days in
the hospital.  The daughters decided that care should move
toward comfort measures only.  Efforts were made to pursue care
such that the patient would remain alive over the weekend so
that he may have visitors.  Of note the patient was noted to
disseminated multi-drug resistant Klebsiella infection by blood
culture, sputum culture, and urine culture.  No antibiotics wore
started.  Comfort measure only care was instituted in full on
[**7-22**] with the goal of making the patient comfortable.  The
patient went into respiratory failure on  the evening of [**7-23**]
and expired that night.  Attending was duly notified.  The
family was notified.  Autopsy was declined.

In summary Mr [**Known lastname 24642**], is an 80 year-old gentleman with a
history of stage 3b terminal lung cancer, atrial fibrillation
and severe coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxic
respiratory failure requring intubation that was secondary to
total R bronchial obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia.
It became clear that efforts to treat his disease proved futile
in the setting of his terminal disease, and eventually the
patient placed in comfort measure only care and passed away.

Reason: IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old woman with recently dx lung ca [**8-1**] with increased
SOB and outside report of lung mass compression of airway
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 72-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung
cancer with increased shortness of breath. Please evaluate
extent of mass.

Multidetector CT images were obtained through the chest with
contrast at 1.25 and 5 mm reconstructions in the lung algorithm.

COMPARISON: Portable chest [**2187-9-11**] and [**2187-9-12**].

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a large mass within the left
lung abutting the left heart border and invading the mediastinal
airway and vascular structures. This mass causes complete
collapse of the left upper lobe bronchus and partial collapse of
left lower lobe bronchus. Measurable solid components measures
8.4 x 5.6 cm (2:25) and 3.1 x 3.1 cm (2:34). This mass
compresses the left main pulmonary artery to a diameter of 5 mm
(2:21). Additionally, the left main stem bronchus is narrowed to
3 mm at the hilum of this invasive mass and adjacent
lymphadenopathy. Large conglomerate lymph nodes in the
subcarinal and right hilar region also causes narrowing of the
right bronchus intermedius to 3.5 mm and compression of the
right upper lobe bronchus. This right hilar lymphadenopathy
measures up to 22 mm. Additionally, there is a very large right
supraclavicular lymph node measuring 34 x 41 mm.

The patient is intubated. Just above the level of the carina,
lymphadenopathy compresses the trachea to 10 mm x 9 mm.

Within the remainder of the lung fields, multiple metastatic
nodules and masses are identified, the largest within the right
middle lobe measuring 28 x 35 mm. There are no significant
pleural effusions.

The heart is normal in size. As described above, there is
significant narrowing of the left main pulmonary artery. There
is probable narrowing of the left main pulmonary artery that is
compressed between subcarinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy
(2:26). There are atherosclerotic calcifications seen within the
aorta and coronary arteries. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

Within the imaged portion of the abdomen, the gallbladder is
noted to be distended (2:59). Additionally, just above the
gallbladder is a subtle rounded density, which may represent
metastatic lesion measuring 5.1 x 4.7 cm, (series 2:54). This
lesion is seen best on liver windows. The imaged portions of the
pancreas and spleen are normal. The adrenal glands are
thickened, but no focal masses are identified.

Bone windows show no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic
osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large central left lung mass with post-obstructive collapse
of left upper lobe and partial collapse left lower lobe.
Associated large bilateral hilar and mediastinal conglomerate
lymph nodes, which encase the airway and the central pulmonary
arteries. Additional findings of metastatic disease throughout
the lungs and a large right supraclavicular lymph node.
2. Trachea and bronchi are encased/narrowed by conglomerate
nodal disease, with most severe narrowing at left main bronchus
proximal to left upper lobe obstruction.
3. Oval soft-tissue density structure in gallbladder fossa
region, likely a distended, sludge filled gallbladder but solid
mass is difficult to exclude. A right upper quadrant ultrasound
is recommended to confirm and further characterize this finding.
4. Probable discrete mass within the right lobe of the liver
superior to the gallbladder fossa. This finding can be evaluated
on the right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate the
gallbladder.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72 year-old female recently diagnosed with
NSCLC [**8-1**] undergoing cehmotherapy (last [**2187-9-4**]) transferred
from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] Interventional Pulmonology
service at the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2187-9-11**]
for evaluation of central airway obstruction and possible stent
placement.
.
On HD 1, she had an elevated WBC of 46.5 and her chest x-ray
demonstrated complete whiteout of the left chest.  She was
afebrile and was empirically started on vancomycin and
meropenem.  She was placed on BIPAP 10 and 5 to maintain her
oxygenation.
.
On HD 2, she underwent an elective intubation and bronchoscopy
which demonstrated extrinsic compression of the left and right
mainstem bronchi.  For details of the operation, please refer to
the operative report.  She was continued on the antibiotics and
remained afebrile.
.
On HD 3 the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy, flexible
bronchoscopy, balloon dilatation, and Ultraflex covered metallic
stent placement (40 x 10) in the LLL.  For details of the
operation, please refer to the operative report.  She was
continued on the antibiotics,  remained afebrile and intubated.
Status post stent placement, the patient was found to have a-fib
and metoprolol and amiodarone were started.
.
On HD 4, she was continued on the antibiotics and remained
afebrile.  She ahd converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  She
was extubated early in the morning, however, by mid evening it
was found that she was having progressive respiratory failure
and re-intubation was done.  She underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy with tumor excision.  For details of the operation,
please refer to the operative report.
.
On HD 5, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic
aspiration
of retained secretions.  For details of the operation, please
refer to the operative report.  Trials of pressure support for
extubation failed with increasing respiratory rates and poor
arterial blood gases.
.
On HD 6, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with tumor
excision.  For details of the operation, please refer to the
operative report.  She was continued on the antibiotics and
remained afebrile.  Her WBC count had progressively decreased to
11.4.  Continued trials at extubation failed.
.
On HD 7, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration
of retained secretions.  For details of the operation, please
refer to the operative report.  She was continued on the
antibiotics and remained afebrile.  Continued attempts to wean
fromthe ventilator failed.
.
On HD 8, it was decided that she would benefit from pulmonary
rehabilitation for ventilator weaning.  She was continued on
BIPAP for good part of the afternoon without difficulty.  She
was continued on the antibiotics and remained afebrile.
.
On HD 9, it was decided to trasnfer her to a ventilatory
rehabilitation facility for further weaning off the vent.  Her
family was in agreement.  She was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility close to her home and will be followed by her primary
care physician as well as her oncologist for further treatment.

Patient will undergo a speech and swallow evaluation and pending
her passing the evaluation, she will resume a normal diet. Until
this is so, she will continue on tube feeds.

Chief Complaint:
Nausea/Vomitting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunnelled catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 61512**] is a 65 year-old woman who presented with nausea
and vomiting after receiving two cycles of full dose
Carboplatinum and Taxol chemotherapy. On [**6-19**] she received her
first weekly treatment using low dose Carboplatinum and Taxol.
This was supposed to be given simultaneously with radiation
therapy.
Her creatinine on the day of treatment was 0.9. She again
experienced considerable nausea and vomiting and came to [**Hospital1 18**]
EW where she was found to have acute renal failure, hyponatremia
and hypochloremia. She is admitted for management of these
problems.
.
Prior to admission she presented with SOB and dyspnea on
exertion to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2194-3-25**] where CT showed a 1.5 cm
tumor filling the superior pulmonary vein draining the upper and
middle lobe on the right. Extensive workup includig flexible
bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy ([**2194-3-28**]) and cervical
mediastinoscopy of multiple levels of nodes ([**2194-3-29**]) did not
reveal a histologic iagnosis. PET scanning demonstrated activity
only within the right upper lobe mass. MRI of the brain was
negative. She underwent thoracoscopic biopsy of this mass with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] [**2194-4-15**]. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma. As her
PFT's showed moderate to severe obstructive ventilatory defect
and moderately reduced diffusing capacity as well as the fact
that the lung scan showed 40% of her ventiliation and perfusion
occur in her right
lung, she is considered a non- operable candidate despite the
small size of her lesion.

RENAL US ([**6-23**]): Normal size kidneys. No hydronephrosis.
2. Simple cyst arising from the upper pole of the right kidney
measuring up to 5 cm.
CT CHEST (7/35): A well-defined pulmonary nodule measuring
approximately 10 x 9 mm in the right lower lobe. Bilateral
diffuse emphysema
FEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFT ([**6-28**]): Left groin hematoma versus a
mostly thrombosed pseudoaneurysm within the left groin,
containing a small amount of arterial flow. No identifiable neck
between the common femoral artery and this fluid collection.
CT CONSTRAST W/O CONTRAST ([**6-29**]): Organizing left groin
hematoma, without evidence of retroperitoneal extension. 6mm
pulmonary nodule at the right lung base; in this patient with
known malignancy. Simple right renal cyst.
Severe degenerative change and scoliosis of the lumbosacral
spine.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFT ([**6-30**]): Left groin hematoma. No
evidence of pseudoaneurysm


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 61512**] is a 65 yo lady with non operable localized NSCLC
admitted with nausea/vomiting, ARF and electrolyte
abnormalities. She was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after development of L
groin hematoma and HCT drop after attempts at catheter placement
for dialysis. She was stabilized in the ICU and then transfered
back to the medicine floor on [**2194-7-1**].
.
1. Left groin hematoma - as a complication of attempted line
placement for hemodyalysis, Hct drop to 19, s/p 2 units of PRBCs
on [**6-28**], Hct to 27.6. The hematoma is currently stable,
resolving slowly. Repeat ultrasound showed no pseudoaneysm
formation and a stable L groin hematoma. CT pelvis was performed
and showed no sign of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Patient
transfused 2 units of pRBCs during dialysis the day of discharge
to increase Hct.
.
2. Acute renal failure: Diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis
thought to be [**1-1**] to platinum based chemotherapy and pre-renal
failure due to dehydration. With thrombocytopenia, anemia,
increasing creatine, HUS/TTP was considered.  A peripheral smear
did not reveal any significant schistocytes. She then became
oligouric and a test dose of 40 of lasix was given with little
urine output.  As her creatine continued to rise to 10, she was
dialysed. Urine output still inadequate but improving slightly,
now >300cc/day. IR placed tunnelled catheter on [**7-3**] for
outpatient dialysis, procedure was tolerated well. She will be
discharged with dialysis to be done 2-3 times weekly at [**Hospital1 18**]
until renal function improves.
.
3. Non small cell lung cancer: non-operable, currently not
receiving any chemo due to complicated hospital course. Patient
was treated in house with daily radiation. She will continue
radiation treatment at [**Hospital1 18**] followed by radiation oncology.
.
4. Constipation: likely due to prolonged bed rest. Patient's
constipation resolved with soap water enemas. Bowel regimen in
hospital included psyllium, senna, glycerine supps, and
citrucel.
.
5. Nausea/Vomitting: Thought to be multifactorial, causes
include ARF and prior chemotherapy treatment. Under better
control during her hospital stay. Managed with Phenergan,
Anzemet, and Compazine
.
6. Hyponatremia: Thought to be secondary to salt wasting
nephropathy. Her input and output were carefully monitored and
she was initially started on NS and her sodium increased from
121 to 125 over twenty four hours.  She was then converted to
2amp bicarb/1/2NS to address both the hyponatremia and metabolic
acidosis, with clinical signs of fluid overload, and little
urine output she was discontinued from IVF. Electrolytes being
managed by nephrology during dialysis.
.
8. FEN: Renal diet. No IVF due to ARF.

CXR [**9-24**]:IMPRESSION:  More extensive parenchymal infiltrate in
right mid lung field exceeding the previously described hilar
prominence and densities related to patient's lung cancer shown
by CT.  The now present parenchymal infiltrates may represent
the clinically suspected infection and followup chest
examinations after treatment is recommended

CXR [**9-25**]: FINDINGS: Compared with the study of [**9-24**], there has
been further interval consolidation of the right mid lung
infiltrate.

LENIs:FINDINGS: Bilateral [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**]
of the lower extremities including the common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal
flow, augmentation and waveforms were demonstrated. Mid portion
of the left superficial femoral was poorly compressible, but
intraluminal thrombus was not identified.

IMPRESSION: No acute DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
51M with metastatic NSC lung CA with mets to brain admitted with
dyspnea.

The patient was admitted for significant respiratory distress
which worsened precipitously throughout the first 24-48 hours of
his admission. He was on a nonrebreather mask breathing at 40-50
bpm, despite being treated with antibiotics for potential
pulmonary infection.
.
He was DNR/DNI on admission, and his health care proxy (wife)
transitioned his goals of care to comfort measures only in the
afternoon of [**9-26**]. The patient was placed on a morphine drip and
maintained on a NRB throughout the night. He desaturated over
the course of 12 hours and passed away at 0514 on [**9-27**]. The

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right middle lobe bronchus
stent removal with hemoptysis/airway secretion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 53-year-old female with
past medical history significant for Stage III-B nonsmall
cell lung cancer diagnosed in fall of [**2142**] with recurrent C,
Factor VIII deficiency, and epilepsy, who presents with
hemoptysis, and excessive secretions status post right main
bronchus stent removal.  Originally patient was diagnosed
with nonsmall cell lung cancer in fall of [**2142**], and was
treated with XRT and chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol.
Her disease reoccurred in [**2143-5-5**], and she was again
treated with XRT with minimal response.  The lung cancer had
then progressed.

On [**2145-5-3**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy (via cytology
revealed nonsmall cell lung cancer) with stent placement in
the bronchus intermedius.  Poststent CT demonstrated adequate
placement.  However, the patient was unable to tolerate the
stent with persistent cough and increased secretions.  She
presents today for elective stent removal.  The procedure was
complicated by 150 cc of hemoptysis poststent removal which
was controlled with suctioning and airway protection.

On arrival, the patient complains of shortness of breath with
increased nonbloody secretions which is improved with
nebulized lidocaine.  She also complains of mild anterior
right chest discomfort which is chronic and pleuritic.  She
denies any nausea, vomiting, headache, chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Stage III-B (T4 M0 N0) nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed
in fall of [**2142**] treated with carboplatin/Taxol induction with
low dose XRT.  She also had a second XRT treatment in [**2143-5-5**] and had suffered some radiation pneumonitis.
2. Catanenial epilepsy treated in [**2134**].
3. Factor VIII deficiency.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Klonopin 0.25 mg po q4h, 0.5 mg po q hs.
2. Estrogen 0.3 mg po q day.
3. Progesterone 200 mg po q day.
4. Albuterol prn.

ALLERGIES:  Chemical sensitivity to quinolones, macrolides,
aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and penicillin.
She develops hives with levofloxacin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married with two children.  She has a
30 pack year smoking history, who quit in [**2142-9-4**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with lung cancer and hemophilia,
maternal grandmother with breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  144/81, 100% on
face mask, respiratory rate 34, pulse of 133, temperature
96.5.  Generally, this is a white female in mild distress,
appearing anxious.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae with clear dry
oropharynx.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck
is supple without lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary:  Decreased
breath sounds in the right base [**4-6**] of the way up with some
bronchial breath sounds, egophony, and decreased tactile
fremitus.  The left lung is clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, normal S1, S2.  No murmurs or
thrills noted.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema noted.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented
times three and moving all four extremities.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count is 7.1, hematocrit
31.7, platelets 584.  Sodium 136, potassium 4, chloride 98,
bicarb 21, BUN 10, creatinine 0.4, glucose 144, calcium 9.1,
magnesium 1.5, phosphate is 3.9.  Bronchial brushing showed a
positive sample of nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.  Pleural
fluid on [**5-3**] show reactive mesothelial cells and no
malignant cells.  On [**2145-4-5**] chest CT scan status post stent
showed stent in the right upper lobe bronchus marked with
narrowing of origin in the right middle bronchus, moderate
pericardial effusion, small partial loculated right pleural
effusion, right middle lobe opacity, and diffuse emphysema.

A [**2145-5-21**] chest x-ray showed moderate large right pleural
effusion, new consistent with compared with chest x-ray on
[**2145-5-7**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary - Hemoptysis:  Patient was initially admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit to keep her saturation above 92%.
Her secretions and cough were managed with Fentanyl and
saline nebulizer treatments.  She did not have any episode of
hemoptysis while in the Intensive Care Unit, and actually
came down from her oxygen requirement from 100% nonrebreather
to sating 90% 4-5 liters. Her hematocrit remained stable.
She was called out to the floor where she was quite stable
until the second day on the medical floor, where she then
experienced three tablespoons of hemoptysis.  She was then
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
observation.  Her hematocrit remained stable and her
hemoptysis decreased in frequency from seven episodes a day
to just five episodes a day with sputum production consistent
with a rust colored phlegm.  She had no frank hemoptysis
while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was then
called out to the medical floor where she soon had greater
than 150 cc hemoptysis.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was aggressively attempted that
the patient could not be revived.  Her airway could not be
managed with the blood that was aspirated during her episode
of hemoptysis.  The code was finally called off at 2 am on
[**2145-6-1**] with pronunciation of death secondary to aspiration
from hemoptysis.

In regards to her pulmonary effusion, it was thought that
there was no need for a thoracentesis at this time.  If the
patient was to spike a fever, the Pulmonary team would
consider thoracentesis, however, she never did spike a fever.

2. Infectious Disease:  The patient did have [**4-6**] blood
cultures on [**2145-5-26**] and sputum that grew out MSSA.  She was
initially treated with Vancomycin 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] and continued on
Vancomycin given that she might develop sensitivities to
other types of antibiotics and the fact that she was
tolerating Vancomycin quite well.  Given that her Vancomycin
trough was less than 10, her dosage was increased to 1250 mg
IV bid of the Vancomycin.  A transesophageal echocardiogram
was never done because the patient requested that she have
some time to recover from her hemoptysis.

3. Nonsmall cell lung cancer:  The patient was initially
going to be setup for phototherapy.  However, before this
could be attempted, it was felt that her lung cancer had
eroded into pulmonary arteries leading to the hemoptysis
which eventually led to her death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Death secondary to aspiration from hemoptysis from
nonsmall lung cancer eroding to pulmonary arteries.
2. Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
3. Nonsmall cell lung cancer.

DATE OF DEATH:  [**2145-6-1**] at 2 am.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a history of
small cell lung cancer.  She was admitted to the medical
intensive care unit after being found with hypoxic
respiratory failure at her nursing home.  At the time of
presentation to [**Hospital1 69**] she was
febrile with an absolute neutrophil count of 40.  She
required large amounts of intravenous fluid and hemodynamic
support from her time of presentation.  On arrival in the
NICU she was on Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.  She was also on
mechanical ventilation at that time.  She reached maximum
doses on Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.  At that point
Vasopressin was added.  Despite these measures, it was
difficult to maintain her blood pressure.  Her oxygenation
and ventilation continued to decline over several hours.
Despite numerous interventions on the mode of ventilation and
numerous boluses of intravenous fluid, the patient was unable
to maintain a blood pressure sufficient to profuse her vital
organs.  She passed away on the evening of [**2109-9-27**].

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Septic shock, secondary to MRSA pneumonia.
2.  Small cell lung cancer.

epidural was not functioning, and he did c/o significant pain
postoperatively. He remained in the PACU with poor pain control
despite iv morphine and dilaudid as well as toradol. He was also
noted to be hypotensive postoperatively, necessitating a
neosynephrine drip overnight secondary to hypotension with
decreased urine output. Overnight he remained stable with better
control of his BP to the point that his neo drip was weaned. He
did have adequate urine output.

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, lightheadedness for 3 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93940**] is an 83 y/o M w/PMH significant for lung CA who
presents w/gradually progressing SOB, cough, fatigue and
lightheadedness over the past 3weeks. Per daughter & patient: Pt
was in his usual state of health and able to perform ADLs until
3 wks ago when he suddenly became SOB though pt cannot recall
exact moment he became SOB.  Pt describes feeling as not being
able to breathe in enough air/oxygen. SOB is persistent, occurs
w/slightest movement. SOB only relieved when pt is sitting up
and not moving. SOB is worse at night and pt has been sleeping
w/three large pillows to elevate himself to almost a seating
position. Pt can no longer lie flat on back w/o becoming SOB.
Around this time, pt also has been experiencing lightheadedness,
dizziness and worsening cough w/yellow-whitish sputum. Pt has
been unable to perform ADLs and his 4 children have been
assisting him with activities he would normally do on his own
such as bathing and eating. His daughter also states he has has
had a depressed mood, decreased motivation and has also been
confused, not able to recall the date or what he ate for
breakfast. He has had one episode of syncope during these three
weeks, though he cannot recall when and how long he was
unconscious. Episode of syncope occurred while he was sitting,
he did not fall or hit his head.  Pt also admits to cold
intolerance, LOA and constipation but denies CP, fevers/chills,
diaphoresis, n/v, diarrhea, incontinence, dysuria, urinary
frequency, black or dark stools, blood in stool and hematuria.
.
This AM, pt went for scheduled appointment w/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
[**Hospital1 18**] for his lung CA. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was concerned when he saw
pt and sent him to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

3. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. 4. Increase in size of
multiple lung lesions, some of which again demonstrate cavitary
transformation and peripheral wedge-shaped appearance. The
overall appearance is most concerning for progression of
metastatic disease with differential diagnosis again including
typical and atypical infectious processes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 y/o M w/PMH significant for lung CA who
presented w/gradually progressing SOB, cough, fatigue and
lightheadedness over the past 3weeks w/CXR concerning for PNA or
worsening lung CA. CT performed for further eval also revealed
unilateral pleural effusion and increased pulmonary lesions
concerning for worsening CA or infection.  Differential
diagonisis on presentation included advancing malignancy, CHF,
pneumonia. The patient after admission became hypotensive and
additionally was requiring increasing oxygen support. The
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing care. In the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for possible
pneuominia, with ceftriaxone additionally added as well later.
The patient had large O2 requirements, requiring a
non-rebreather to maintain O2 sats > 90. However, as the patient
was DNR/DNI without presssors, therapies offered in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
were limited. The patient was tried on a trial of CPAP to held
decrease the associated work of breathing but found the CPAP too
uncomfortable and preferred not to use it. The patient therefore
was trasnferred back to the floor for ongoing care. The
patient's prognosis was known to be poor which the patient and
his family were aware of. Therefore, priority was shifted
towards comfort which was guided by the patient's family. As the
patient was lucid and interactive, although markedly tachypnic,
he and his family preferred not to use any narcotics for comfort
initially. However, as the patient's course progressed over a
course of days and he became more tired and confused, the
patient's family guided the use of morphine until a point when
the patient was on a morphine drip titrated to comfort. All
supportive measures including medications, fluids, and lab
checks were discontinued and the patient was allowed to pass
away with his family present. The patient passed away from
respiratory arrest on [**2196-8-13**].

Left Thoracotomy, Left Lower Lobe Lobectomy, Mediastinal Lymph
Node Dissection

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 67yo F with a PMHx significant for HTN
and diverticulitis who was discovered to have a LLL lung cancer
incidentally after an episode of acute, uncomplicated sigmoid
diverticulitis in [**7-22**].  Pre-operative work-up, including whole
body PET-CT and brain MRI showed 2 lesions, a left adrenal and
left lower lobe mass.  Pre-operative assesment confirmed
non-small cell cancer with lung primary and given recent
literature supporting surgical intervention in oligometastatic
patients, the decision to proceed with a left lower lobe
resection was elected.  Pre-operative PFTs and cardiac risk
stratification revealed the patient to be an adequate candidate
for the procedure and on [**2106-12-20**], the patient had an
uncomplicated L-thoracotomy, left lower lobe lobectomy with a
mediastinal lymph node dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Post-operatively, the patient was extubated without event and
went to the floor.  For details of the procedure, see operative
dictation.  On POD#1, the patient went into rapid atrial
fibrillation (Afib) with a rapid ventricular response (RVR).
She was symptomatic with dizziness and lightheadedness as well
as palpatations.  Her systolic BP was measured between 70-90
systolic and possible cardioversion was entertained.  However,
after transfer to the [**Month/Day/Year 58879**], neosynephrine + amiodarone gtt was
utilized and she converted to sinus rhythm the following day.
She had no leak from her chest tube(s) and her other systems
were within normal.  While in the [**Last Name (LF) 58879**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MI protocol with
cardiac markers was unrevealing and she was aggressively
diuresed secondary to possible volume overload.

By the following day, she felt well; however, she lapsed back
into A-fib with a RVR.  Re-bolus of IV amiodarone and
continuation of her beta-blockade was successful in keeping her
rate controlled initially, but, she remained in atrial
fibrillation.  Ultimately, her chest tubes and epidural/foley
were serially removed over post-operative days #[**4-22**].  Follow-up
CXR after tube thoracostomy removal revealed no PTX and adequate
re-expansion of her left lung.  Cardiology consult obtained on
[**2106-12-25**] recommended judicious use of amiodarone in conjunction
with beta blockade.  This transiently worked, however, on POD5,
she returned to a rapid rate and cardiology recommended a
diltiazem drip with transition to an oral regimen of calcium
channel blocker with an amiodarone taper (e.g. 400BID x2weeks,
400 QDaily x2weeks, 200BID x2 weeks, until 100QDaily x 2 weeks),
cessation of her beta-blocker and intiation of anticoagulation
accomplished with lovenox injections as a bridge to therapy with
coumadin.

By discharge, she was stable on oral pain medication, tolerating
a regular [**Doctor First Name **] diet although her blood sugars were slightly
elevated.  She had received 2 days of coumadin and upon
discharge, her INR was 1.9 after receiving 5 mg doses nightly.
She will take 2.5mg of coumadin the night of her discharge.
Lastly, she is to be discharged with home oxygen, keflex for
superficial phlebitis of her IV site x7 days, lovenox injections
to be administered by VNA with daily blood draws for INR also
drawn by VNA.  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-19**] weeks
in his clinic by calling for an appointment and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2903**]

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2165-9-29**] 8:01 PM

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2165-9-19**]:
The irregular right perihilar opacification seen on the previous
study has coalesced, though it may contain central pneumatocele
or bullae with thickened walls. Sequence of changes is
consistent with developing radiation fibrosis which may also
explain a region of consolidation projecting over the mid
thoracic spine seen on the lateral view, but this area could
represent a bacterial infection. Clinical correlation is needed.
Left lung is clear. The heart is normal size. Slight rightward
mediastinal shift is longstanding. A right upper lobe mass is
smaller than it was on [**9-3**] but size measurements are not
practical, still at least 5 cm in greatest diameter. Right
apical pleural thickening and fullness in the right paratracheal
mediastinum are concerning for local tumor extension, but best
evaluated by CT scanning.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-9-29**] 8:09 PM

FINDINGS: The vertebral body heights, alignment, and
intervertebral disc spaces are preserved. The vertebral body
bone marrow signal is normal. No disc herniations are
identified. There is no abnormal signal or enhancement
identified within the cord.

Within the right upper lobe in the right peritracheal region,
there is a large heterogeneously enhancing mass with an apparent
necrotic center. In addition, more inferiorly, there are areas
of lung consolidation. The reader is refereed to the chest CT
and chest x-ray reports for further descriptions regarding these
findings. There is also abnormal soft tissue in the subcarinal
region, which probably represents lymphadenopathy. There does
not appear to be involvement of the adjacent vertebral bodies.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of abnormality within the thoracic spine.

2. Large necrotic right upper lobe mass with lung consolidation
inferiorly and probable subcarinal lymphadenopathy. For further
description of these findings, the reader is referred to the
chest CT and chest x-ray reports.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2165-10-4**] 8:47 PM

IMPRESSION: No significant change compared with earlier the same
day. Two right-sided chest tubes with suspected small right
apical pneumothorax unchanged. Prominence of the right
paratracheal soft tissues again noted

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2165-10-6**] 9:00 AM

Compared with one day earlier, there is new blunting of the
right costophrenic angle, without significant interval change.
Again seen is an elevated right hemidiaphragm and shift of the
mediastinum to the right, with pleural fluid/thickening tracking
along the right chest wall, right apex, and medial aspect of the
upper right mediastinum. Focal lucency and fluid level at the
right lung apex is compatible with a small hydropneumothorax,
unchanged. There is considerable subcutaneous emphysema along
the right chest wall, also unchanged. The left lung remains
grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis/scarring at the left
base.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted pre-operatively and underwent a pre-op
chest x-ray and an MRI of the spine to assess cord invasion of
the tumor.  He continued to have a cough prior to surgery, but
was otherwise afebrile and felt well.  A right upper lobectomy
and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed via a
thoracotomy on [**9-30**] without complication.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
orthopedic spine surgeon was available for intraoperative
collaboration however the tumor was not invading the spinal
structures and dissection was completed without the need for a
spine specialist.  The patient was transferred to the floor
post-operatively with a chest tube and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain in place.
He recovered well and he was encouraged to get out of bed on
POD1 and incentive spirometry was encouraged.  He had an
epidural placed pre-operatively that ceased to work for pain
relief and he was converted to a PCA for pain control on POD1.
Post-operatively he was noted to have slightly increasing
subcutaneous emphysema.  The chest tubes were left in place on
water seal and his subcutaneous emphysema and a small stable
pneumothorax remained stable and eventually decreased somewhat.
His chest tubes were clamped POD4.  He complained of moderately
increasing right chest wall pain on POD4&5 and his pain
medications were adjusted accordingly when chest x-rays revealed
no underlying pathology.  His chest tubes were discontinued POD5
without complication.
He was noted to have a gradual development of a post-operative
anemia and was transfused on POD2 for a HCT of 21.2.  He
developed a fever in the midst of his transfusion and this was
stopped immediately and investigated for a transfusion reaction.
 The work-up was negative and he received the full 2 units at a
later time without further complication.  Cultures taken at that
time were also negative for an infectious source.
He was started on oxycontin for a longer acting pain relief and
this seemed to alleviate his pain except on his first movements
from a stationary position.  He continued to be ambulatory

placing the patient at high risk for pathologic fracture.
Interval resolution of two right upper lobe spiculated opacities
and non-visualization of two right lower lobe nodules.
.
L thigh xray: Large lytic intratrochanteric lesion (33mm in
diamater). No pathologic fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with progressive metastatic lung cancer and
membranous nephropathy who presents with left thigh pain in the
setting of a new left femur lytic lesion.
.
1.  Left lytic femoral bone lesion/fracture:  Pt was found to
have a lytic lesion in the intertrochanteric left femur on
admission.  Radiation oncology was consulted the following day
and recommended radiation.  Orthopedics was also consulted the
following day and at the time it was felt that given the pt's
comorbities that surgery to stabilize the weight-bearing bone
would be risky and recovery would be difficult.  The patient and
his family decided to defer surgery and proceed with radiation
therapy.  The patient was immediately placed on
non-weight-bearing for his left lower extremity; the patient
started with his activity restricted to bedrest and as he did
well, he graduated to out of bed with walker and assist per
orthopedic recommendations.  Physical therapy also worked with
the patient.
.
Unfortunately, the patient sustained a traumatic pathologic
fracture while in the hospital when he fell.  Pt was then found
to have low blood pressure, and was transferred to the intensive
care unit.  He was placed on vasopressors, and treated for a
presumed penumonia.  He was found to have a perifracture
hematoma and was transfused 4 units of PRBCs.  His plavix was
held.  His blood pressure stabilized and he was transferred back
to the oncology floor.
.
After a long discussion involving the primary oncology team and
orthopedics, given the risks of operating, the family decided to
defer surgery for now and complete radiation therapy. Mortality
from surgery was estimated to be 40-50%. Radiation therapy was
resumed.  Patient continued to work with physical therapy.  Pt
received palidronate on [**2159-12-12**]. Repeat xray films of hip,
femur and knee revealed minimal change since time of fracture.
Pt will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for rehabilitation.
.
2.  Chronic renal failure:  Pt has history of membranous
nephropathy associated with malignancy.  Although his creatinine
was elevated, his urine protein/Cr actually improved to his
previous results.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended
holding his home diuretics (bumetanide, HCTTZ) but continuing
with ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] and prednisone with bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
His creatinine improved.  His HCTZ and bumetanide were re-added
as his BP rose. However, he again became hypotensive to 70's and
all antihypertensives were held.  Creatinine was followed
carefully with these additions and remained at his baseline.
.
3.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia, RLL:  His sputum culture grew
Pseudomonas aeroginosa.  He was treated with a 2 week course of
Zosyn. After completing his course patient was intermittiently
hypotensive and tachycardic. There was concern for sepsis and
cultures were sent. Sputum grew out sparse gram negative rods
and patient was started on 2 week course of ceftazidime because
of concern for partially treated pseudomonal pneumonia
(sensitivities to Zosyn were borderline). CT chest was completed
that showed worsening of his lung cancer, scarring secondary to
radiation and areas of persistent pneumonia. Out of concern for
fungal source, pulmonary was consulted. Patient's blood
pressures stabilized and pulmonary felt there was no indication
to bronch patient. His blood pressure stabilized, and He was
sent out to complete a two-week course of IV ceftazidime.
.
4.  COPD:  Pt appears to have wheezing at baseline.  He was
treated with ipatropium and albuterol nebulizers.  Albuterol
nebulizers were changed to levalbuterol nebulizers given the
patient's baseline tachycardia.  During his stay at ICU, he was
given a steroid burst which was tapered back to his home dose of
prednisone.
.
5. Hypertension:  After returning from the ICU, pt was noted to
have high blood pressure.  He was placed back on his complete
home regimen of ACEI, [**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ, and bumetanide.  Beta blockers
were avoided given his poor respiratory status and past records
noting inability to tolerate beta blockers.  However blood
pressure again became tenuous requiring boluses with IV fluids.
Therefore all antihypertensives were held. At time of discharge,
blood pressure ranged from 90-130 systolic.
.
6. Hyperglycemia:  This is likely due to steroids and
olanzapine.  His home glipizide was held and he was placed on a
Humalog insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.
.
7. CHF: Pt was maintained on home regimen of ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **], HCTZ, and
Bumetanide.  He was maintained on a low sodium diet, but all
antihypertensives were held as blood pressure was low.
.
8. CAD:  Pt was continued on his home regimen of statin,
ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **].  Plavix was held after his perifracture hematoma.  He
is allergic to ASA. BP meds held.
.
9. Schizophrenia and Paranoia:  Pt was continued on his
outpatient regimen of olanzapine, lorazepam, and fluphenazine.
His outpatient psychiatrist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10166**] was contact[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] changes
were made to his regimen and patient did not have any auditory
hallucinations while in house.

History of Present Illness:
58 YO woman with SCLC, history of SIADH, syncope presents with a
history of two episodes of syncope.  The first episode occured 3
days ago, which was unwitnessed.  She was walking outside on her
driveway and suddenly fell unconciousness, with no prodrome, or
symptoms preceding the event.  She was unconscious for
approximately 30 minutes by her account, and awoke with no
headache, aura, nausea, vomitting, urinary or fecal
incontinence. The had an abrasion on her Right shoulder after
the fall. The pain is currently [**4-4**]. The second episode occured
the next day while walking in her bedroom, it was not related to
orthostatic changes, rising from a bed, chair.  This episode was
witnessed by her husband, who lifted her up and she awoke.  Of
note, she has had dizziness the past few weeks after receiving
her chemotherapy.  She denied vertigo, the room did not spin,
but rather she felt unsteady on her feet.  Also, she was
originally planned for a line place last Friday [**5-26**], but was
found to be anemic and transfused 1 unit of blood at that time.

ROS:  Denied Heachache, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever
chills, diarrha, + constipation for 3 days, denied dysuria, Pain
in right shoulder [**4-4**].  Also c/o inability to fully void x 1
day (no saddle anesthesia, no bowel incont); no neuro deficits.

She has previous history of syncope where her glucose was found
to be 30. She had 2 other episodes and found to have normal
glucose levels.  She also is found to have hyponatremia, with
the sodium in the 120s.  This is likely due to the SIADH effect
of the tumor.

Past Medical History:
Onc Hx:  58 YO woman presented with dyspnea and cough without
hemoptysis, [**11-9**] wt loss/2months, and fatigue. On chest CT

of an infectious etiology. Aspiration is an additional
consideration.
3. Progression of right-sided mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
subcarinal
lymphadenopathy and left hilar lymphadenopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 58 y/o F with SCLC, history of SIADH, syncope presented
s/p two syncopal episodes and Na of 115.

1. Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially admitted to the
oncology service. However, she developed worsening respiratory
distress during hospitalization. She was evaluated by the ICU
team, at which point she expressed her opposition to any
prolonged intubation. However, as the etiology of her
respiratory distress was unclear, the decision was made to
transfer her to the ICU where she could be placed on BiPAP mask
and a work-up for reversible causes for her dyspnea pursued.
While in the ICU, her respiratory status continued to decline
and she was electively intubated. When a repeat CT of the chest
showed significant progression of her malignancy, the decision
was made to extubate and make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] per her previously
expressed wishes. She expired shortly thereafter.

2. Syncope:  Pt initially admitted for syncope x 2 of unclear
etiology. Ddx included orthostasis (anemia vs dehydration) vs
hypoglycemia vs hyponatremia. Unlikely vasovagal or [**12-28**] sz, by
history. Had head CT neg for bleed or edema. Pt's hyponatremia
was treated with fluid restriction as detailed below.

3. HypoNa: Pt previously diagnosed with SIADH. Had Na=115 on
admission, urine osm=400. Renal was consulted. Per their
recommendations, pt was maintained on fluid restriction of <1.5L
/ day, with Na goal of 115-120s.

4. SCLC: Dx'ed in [**2197-3-26**], S/P D3 VP16 ([**5-17**]), tolerated well.
However, repeat chest CT on [**5-17**] and again on [**6-5**] showed
progression of dz in the mediastinum with mass effect on the
trachea.

5. Neutropenia: Pt was maintained on neutropenic precautions
while neutropenic secondary to chemotherapy. She was
subsequently administered G-CSF, which she responded well to.

6. Anemia: Pt was transfused 1U PRBCs during hospitalization.

Date of Birth:   [**2065-9-3**]     Sex:  M

Service:  THORACIC SURGICAL SERVICE

Notation:  This discharge summary is being dictated two
months following the patient's hospitalization because the
resident assigned to complete it, did not do so.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
gentleman, who never smoked and had a history of Stage I
carcinoma of the lung in [**2130**] treated by right upper
lobectomy.  He did well postoperatively, but recent routine
followup showed a new lesion in the right middle lobe that
was PET positive.  There were no other PET abnormalities, and
pulmonary function studies were satisfactory for surgery.  He
was admitted for probable right middle lobectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Was significant only for his history
of lung cancer.  He denied diabetes, hypertension, or cardiac
disease.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim gave headaches.

OPERATIONS:  Previous lobectomy only.

HABITS:  The patient never smoked, and drinks two beers a
day.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin.
2. Levaquin for prostatitis, recently discontinued.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired teacher and coach,
and now works in real estate.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There was no family history of cancer and
both parents lived to their 80's.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  History of prostatitis only.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no
acute distress with a pulse of 60 and a blood pressure of
130/70.  His lung fields were clear.  There was evidence of a
previous right thoracotomy.  There was no scalene adenopathy.
Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm without extra sounds or
murmurs.

On the day of admission, I performed a mediastinoscopy
followed by a right thoracoscopy, takedown of adhesions, and
a right thoracotomy, and an attempted right middle lobectomy.
Because of heavy hilar scarring, there was pulmonary artery
injury, and the patient required an emergency right
pneumonectomy.  This was complicated by blood transfusion.

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  He was able to be
extubated shortly after surgery, and despite his
intraoperative problems, made an excellent recovery, and was
discharged on the fifth postoperative day.  He was given pain
medication and followup.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
64 y.o. man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA,
non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for
hemoptysis.  He was admitted to OSH on [**12-28**] with fever and
borderline neutropenia; he was started on levofloxacin for ? RUL
PNA. He developed massive hemoptysis and was transferred here
intubated. He remained febrile and neutropenic. He has undergone
two major IR procedures to stop the bleeding from his RUL which
is full of tumor.  There are no further interventions that IR
can do if he bleeds more.  Thoracics has seen him in case he
bleeds more an needs emegency surgery.
.
On day of admission to the OSH, pt noted himself to be febrile
to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with
some blood tinged sputum. He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss
over 2 weeks PTA.  Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was
already on for salmonella prophylaxis.  CXR showed increased
opacity of RUL c/w PNA.
.
On [**12-30**], he developed hemoptysis. He was taken to the OR,
intubated on [**12-31**]. A bronchosopy was performed which showed a
large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active
bleeding. The patient maintained good oxygenation and
ventilation on the ventilator. A pre-bronch Hct was 26.1 (from
28 on admit) and went to 24.3 post-bronch and 21.2 thereafter.
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4.
.
In terms of his NSCLC treatment, he has undergone three cycles
of Taxol/Carboplatin, completed ~4 weeks PTA. Treatment was
halted [**1-11**] pancytopenia. Has also been receiving radiation
treatment with last treatment [**2113-12-28**]. Has received about 24
treatments (5 treatments/wk x 5 weeks). Has been taking Procrit
for chronic anemia, and received 1U PRBC on [**2113-12-22**]. Also on
daily SC neupogen, started in-house.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for the specific
interventional radiology and pulmonology procedures unique to
the institution.  Multiple attempts to control the bleeding via
selective embolization were undertaken, and tenuous hemostasis
was acheived.  The patient, who had been intubated for airway
protection, was extubated without incident and suffered no
respiratory failure.  He had arrived with fever and neutropenia
from the OSH, and vanco/caspo/cefepime broad coverage was
initiated.  Multiple cultures were drawn given the persistent
fever, and all were negative in the final read.  Although the
patient was stabilized via multiple bronchoscopies and
interventional radiologic procedures, rebleeding remains a
significant risk, and little could be done if another
catastrophic bleed were to develop.
.
His persisent neutropenia was unexpected so far out from his
last dose of chemotherapy.  However, with persistent Neupogen
dosing the patient's ANC and total leukocyte counts gradually
increased into a non-neutropenic state.  He was continued on
vanc/cefepime/caspo until ANC > 1000, then all were discontinued
since the patient had remained afebrile for > 48 hours and had
persistently negative culture data.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was with stable
hematocrit, adequate pain control, stable O2 requirement,
improving functional mobility, and good mental status.  The
family would like to transition care to Hospice, likely at a
long-term institution as this patient would be very difficult to
care for at home.
.
Plan:
.
#. Hemoptysis: Recently extubated, with stable Hct and no
visible hemoptysis.  IR options have been exhausted.  CT surgery
has evaluated patient and would only take back to the OR if
massive bleeding recurs.  IP and IR have exhausted all options.
Patient will likely suffer recurrent bleeding and hemoptysis
despite our best efforts.
-- QD Hct.  Would likely be very obvious if rebleeds.
Transfused 1u PRBC [**1-15**].
-- End of life issues currently being addressed with family, SW
involved, palliative care involved.
-- Patient recently extubated.  Follow pulmonary exam and VS for
signs of decompensation.  Continue inhalers.  Nebs available
PRN.
-- Respiratory status stable, slightly improved over last
several days.
-- Hct slow decrease over past week, may be [**1-11**] decreased
production.  1u PRBC transfused on [**1-15**].  No signs of active
bleeding.  Hemolysis labs negative.
.
#. Fever/Neutropenia: Cause of neutropenia remains obscure,
definitely a component of chemo-induced neutropenia, but also a
possible component of HCL relapse.  Filgrastim being held now
for lack of response.  Heme/Onc followed throughout
hospitalization.  Off all abx currently, patient has not spiked
a fever, although temps were increased last night.  Will
continue to culture if spikes greater than 100.4.
-- Afebrile >72 hours, no F/C.
-- Off all abx since [**1-12**]
-- Culture if > 100.4
-- Have held filgrastim.
-- ANC each AM, CBC with diff
-- ANC decreased slightly over past 2 days, 810 the AM of
discharge.  Per primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] at [**Hospital3 **],
this is close to his baseline.
.
#. NSCLC and HCL: Large tumor burden.  Chemo has been d/c'd due
to pancytopenia.  Has gotten 24 doses of XRT.  Unclear if any
further chemo/rads would be beneficial; will follow heme/onc
recommendations.  Patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] as outpatient.
-- Appreciate Heme/onc recommendations, unsure if palliative
chemo/rads would be indicated.  Certainly chemo could not be
undertaken right now due to low blood counts.  Completed 24
doses of XRT prior to admission.
-- Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] after discharge
-- No filgrastim for now as above
-- Morphine PRN for pain
.
#. History of positive PPD: Continuing INH as per previous.
Been on therapy since [**Month (only) 462**] or [**2113-9-9**], started
after low grade fevers and cough with positive PPD.
-- Continue INH for now.
.
#. History of salmonella sepsis: Patient on chronic levaquin as
outpatient for this.  Have resumed after d/c of F&N coverage.
-- Continue levaquin prophylaxis.
.
#. LE edema: EF normal on echo, although ? of ASD.  No
intervention would be warranted at this time as pressures appear
normal and no evidence of shunting with saline contrast.  Due to
strong cancer history, concern for LE DVTs.  LENIs checked prior
to discharge.
-- R popliteal DVT seen on [**1-16**], very distal with no proximal
extension
-- *** This should be followed up in 1 week to assess for
proximal extension ***
-- Patient would be an extremely poor candidate for
anticoagulation
.
#. Hyperglycemia(?): Patient on RISS, has had several high FS
recorded.  Will continue RISS for now, as tight glycemic control
is likely to be beneficial from an ID standpoint.
-- Continue RISS
.
#. Hypertension: Transitioned from labetolol to metoprolol.
Will follow BP and titrate up B-blocker as tolerated/required.
-- Follow BP and titrate metoprolol as needed, good control
recently.
.
#. MS changes: Seems improved greatly since transfer out of ICU.
 Patient with likely ICU delirium, fluctuant mental status.
Pain control medications likely not helping this.  At time of
discharge patient was A&Ox3.
-- Consider low dose IV haldol if recurrs
.
#. Prostate CA: History of prostate CA s/p radiation treatment
in [**2112**].  Patient reports significant urinary
frequency/hesitancy at home.
-- Patient unable to void yesterday, straight cath'ed with 600cc
drainage and patient relief.  Foley left in place.
-- Started Flomax at outpatient dose.
-- Should have voiding trial with d/c foley after transfer to
rehab.
.
#. Dysuria: Developed dysuria [**1-14**].  Have d/c'd foley and checked
UA, cx.  UA with 50 RBC, 0-2 WBC, moderate bacteria.
-- Levaquin ongoing.
-- Urine culture negative
.
#. Diarrhea: New onset of diarrhea over weekend, moderate in
severity.  Have sent for c. diff, would be at risk for this
given recent ICU stay and broad spectrum antibiotics.
-- C. diff negative.
.
#. FEN: General diet, soft with thin liquids per S&S.  Will
provide IVF as needed to keep I/O even.  Replete lytes PRN.
.
#. PPX: No heparin [**1-11**] bleeding risk.  On PPI, will continue.
Elevate HOB > 30 degrees.  Fall precautions.
.
#. Code: DNR/DNI following discussion with wife, who is HCP.
Confirmed again with patient prior to discharge on [**1-16**].  Patient
is not to be intubated or rescucitated under any circumstances.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old
male with persistent cough found to have left upper lobe mass
on chest x-ray.  Chest CT on [**2190-11-9**] confirmed the presence
of a 6 cm cavitary left upper lobe mass and right hilar
lymphadenopathy.  The patient has lost about 30 pounds in the
past six weeks.  Fatigued on standing.  Persistent cough.
Right shoulder pain for the past six weeks with certain
movements.  No headaches.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post XRT eight years ago for
prostate cancer.  Mild hypertension.  Pedal edema.  AAA 2.4
cm in [**5-9**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg twice weekly.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was a well appearing
normal in no acute distress.  HEENT pupils equally round and
reactive to light.  No scleral icterus.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs.  Abdomen negative.  Extremities no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Neuro no focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  CAT scan on [**2190-11-9**] showed a 6 cm large
cavitary left upper lobe mass and 2 cm right hilar mass.  PET
scan reported no peripheral mets, but question mediastinal
involvement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2191-1-12**] and was
taken directly to the operating room where left upper lobe
resection and ribs two, three and four resections were
performed.  The patient did all right postoperatively and was
transferred to the surgical ICU postoperatively, intubated.
On transfer the patient didn't have any problems
postoperatively.  This was particularly important because the
patient was an extremely difficult intubation.  The patient
had an epidural in place for pain.  He received Kefzol
perioperatively.  He did have some postoperative oliguria
requiring periodic fluid boluses.  Chest tubes were in place
and to suction.

On postoperative day one the patient was successfully
extubated.  He had his diet advanced successfully and was
heplocked.  He was transferred to the floor.  He stayed on
the floor for another three days secondary to high chest tube
output.  On [**2191-1-17**] the chest tubes were removed
successfully.  His epidural was removed and the patient was
changed to p.o. pain medication.  He is doing well and will
be discharged in the morning to a rehab facility.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old male who
presented with persistent cough and right shoulder pain and
was found to have a left upper lobe on chest x-ray.  A
computerized tomography scan on [**2190-11-9**], confirmed
the presence of a 6 cm cavitary left upper lobe mass and
there was also question of a right hilar lymph node.  On
[**2190-12-22**], he underwent a mediastinoscopy after which
he was found to have a resectable left lung tumor.  At this
time he was admitted for resection of the left upper lobe
mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post radiation therapy eight
years ago for prostate cancer, mild hypertension, 2.4 cm
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg twice weekly.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, retired with 30 year history of
smoking two packs per day, quit 30 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, well-appearing in no
apparent distress.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologically intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of this admission, he underwent
a left upper lobectomy and resection of the chest wall
overlying the tumor which included segments of ribs 2, 3 and
4.  He tolerated the procedure well, but secondary to a very
difficult intubation he was kept intubated over night
immediately postoperatively and was therefore in the
Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours.  The next morning he
extubated with no difficulty and after that his course is
summarized as follows.

1.  Neurological - His pain was initially controlled with an
epidural and then was well controlled on p.o. pain
medication.  He did present with slight confusion early
postoperatively but was back to his baseline mental status
with no neurological deficits thereafter and this was
attributed to postoperative delirium and narcotics.

2.  Cardiovascular - He remained stable postoperatively and
required no additional medications.  Due to slight
bradycardia early postoperatively, he was not started on any
beta blockade perioperatively.

3.  Respiratory - He remained stable with good saturations
initially with some oxygen later on room air.  Chest tubes
were removed on postoperative day #5.  Chest x-ray
demonstrated good inflation of the remaining segment of the
left lung with a small residual space.  Prior to discharge he
is comfortable and his saturations were 97% on room air.

4.  Gastrointestinal - His diet was advanced as tolerated and
he tolerated that with no difficulty.

5.  Genitourinary - His urine output was good at all times
and renal function was maintained.  He had no difficulty
voiding after the Foley catheter was removed.

6.  Heme - He remained stable and required no blood products
during the hospitalization.  His hematocrit on [**2191-1-14**], postoperatively was 32.9.

7.  Infectious disease - There were no active issues.  He was
covered with Cefazolin perioperatively which was continued
for a few days after surgery and he will stop with discharge.
He remained afebrile with a normal white count and his wound
was healing well.

8.  Musculoskeletal - Activity was gradually advanced with
the assistance of physical therapy.  It was felt that he will
benefit from a short stay in a rehabilitation facility to
assist him to get back to baseline activities.

He is discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation
facility with the following recommendations:

Admission Date:  [**2191-1-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2191-1-18**]


Service:  Thoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old male who
presented with persistent cough and right shoulder pain and
was found to have a left upper lobe on chest x-ray.  A
computerized tomography scan on [**2190-11-9**], confirmed
the presence of a 6 cm cavitary left upper lobe mass and
there was also question of a right hilar lymph node.  On
[**2190-12-22**], he underwent a mediastinoscopy after which
he was found to have a resectable left lung tumor.  At this
time he was admitted for resection of the left upper lobe
mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post radiation therapy eight
years ago for prostate cancer, mild hypertension, 2.4 cm
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg twice weekly.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, retired with 30 year history of
smoking two packs per day, quit 30 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, well-appearing in no
apparent distress.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologically intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of this admission, he underwent
a left upper lobectomy and resection of the chest wall
overlying the tumor which included segments of ribs 2, 3 and
4.  He tolerated the procedure well, but secondary to a very
difficult intubation he was kept intubated over night
immediately postoperatively and was therefore in the
Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours.  The next morning he
extubated with no difficulty and after that his course is
summarized as follows.

1.  Neurological - His pain was initially controlled with an
epidural and then was well controlled on p.o. pain
medication.  He did present with slight confusion early
postoperatively but was back to his baseline mental status
with no neurological deficits thereafter and this was
attributed to postoperative delirium and narcotics.

2.  Cardiovascular - He remained stable postoperatively and
required no additional medications.  Due to slight
bradycardia early postoperatively, he was not started on any
beta blockade perioperatively.

3.  Respiratory - He remained stable with good saturations
initially with some oxygen later on room air.  Chest tubes
were removed on postoperative day #5.  Chest x-ray
demonstrated good inflation of the remaining segment of the
left lung with a small residual space.  Prior to discharge he
is comfortable and his saturations were 97% on room air.

4.  Gastrointestinal - His diet was advanced as tolerated and
he tolerated that with no difficulty.

5.  Genitourinary - His urine output was good at all times
and renal function was maintained.  He had no difficulty
voiding after the Foley catheter was removed.

6.  Heme - He remained stable and required no blood products
during the hospitalization.  His hematocrit on [**2191-1-14**], postoperatively was 32.9.

7.  Infectious disease - There were no active issues.  He was
covered with Cefazolin perioperatively which was continued
for a few days after surgery and he will stop with discharge.
He remained afebrile with a normal white count and his wound
was healing well.

8.  Musculoskeletal - Activity was gradually advanced with
the assistance of physical therapy.  It was felt that he will
benefit from a short stay in a rehabilitation facility to
assist him to get back to baseline activities.

He is discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation
facility with the following recommendations:

1.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as scheduled, see discharge
sheet.
2.  Continue current medications, again as summarized in the
discharge sheet and including Percocet prn for pain, Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as long as taking pain medications,
Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs every 6 hours prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Left lung tumor, status post left upper
lobectomy with chest wall resection.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 yo man w/ long smoking history, recent recurrent
PNA's, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 1562**] Hospitalto thoracics
service on [**2162-12-31**] for work up of lung mass,throacics/IP
consultation, with concern for lung ca. He has had
recurrent, right sided pneumonias in recent months and was
initially
admitted to [**Hospital1 1562**] w/ shortness of breath. Initial
brochnoscopy
at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-31**] showed endobronchial, friable, ""pearly

airway showed large tumor burden on right with almost total
collapse of
RLL (see below for report). Patient then had rigid bronch on
[**1-4**] which showed tumor origin extending into RLL orifice,
obstructing entire RLL. Tumor excision and destruction was
performed. Prelim
biopsy report c/w lung ca, but final report pending.
Patient was dischared home [**1-6**] to complete staging w/u (PET,

nonfocal with intact and appropriate mental status.


Pertinent Results:
CT trachea [**2163-1-1**]:
Near-complete collapse of the right lower lobe secondary to a
mass which obstructs the right lower lobe segmental bronchi and
extends up to
the level of the right middle lobe origin.

Bronchoscopy report [**2163-1-4**]:
There was normal anatomy down to the level of the right lower
lobe. The right lower lobe had a white necrotic obstructing
lesion emanating from the superior segment of the lower lobe
(S6) and completely obstructing the right lower lobe. The right
middle lobe was spared. The right middle
lobe carina was spared.

P-MIBI on [**2163-1-21**]:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left ventricular
cavity
size and systolic function.
CXR [**2163-1-24**]:
Moderate right pneumothorax with chest tubes in place.

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2163-1-29**] AT 16:31.
INDICATION: Recent lobectomy surgery - check PTX.
COMPARISON: [**2163-1-29**] AT 13:06.
FINDINGS:
Compared with the prior study, the right chest catheter remains
in place, and there is a persistent lower component
pneumothorax, unchanged from prior. Pneumomediastinum also
persists, unchanged. A bit more patchiness in opacity is seen in
the right lower lung field, a finding which should be reassessed
on subsequent followup studies.
Left lung remains clear.
IMPRESSION:Stable right basilar PTX. Possible developing
airspace disease in the right base.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was planned to go to the OR on [**2163-1-21**] for VATS /
RLLobectomy. OR was delayed for acute chest pain with
bradycardia, no EKG changes or increase in cardiac markers were
seen. Cardiology was consulted in the pre-operative area and OR
was delayed. Due to a suboptimal pre-op exercise stress test a
Persanthine MIBI was obtained which was normal. Per cardiology
note, this presentation was consistent with an increase in vagal
output likely [**1-20**] pain, a cold room etc.

On [**2163-1-24**], the patient was taken for R VATS and R lower
lobectomy (see operative log for details). The procedure was
uncomplicated and the patient was transfered postoperatively to
the ICU.

On [**2163-1-25**], the patient was transfered to the floor.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
female with limited stage small cell lung cancer who was
treated with three cycles of carboplatin/etoposide and
concurrent radiation therapy completed in [**10-24**].  Treatment
course was complicated by pneumonia and her fourth course of
chemotherapy was held.  She did relatively well until [**12-24**]
when she complained of headache.  Temporal artery biopsy was
performed and was negative, so she was put on prednisone
taper.

More recently, she has been complaining of decreased
appetite, increased shortness of breath, nausea, and
vomiting.  Laboratory work included increased LFTs.  CT scan
torso yesterday revealed a large pericardial effusion from an
epi-pericardial mass resulting in right heart failure.  She
was electively admitted for management of pericardial
effusion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and PTCA with stent placement.
3. Chronic lower back pain.
4. Small cell lung cancer.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Levoxyl 75 mg po q day.
2. Paxil 30 mg po q day.
3. Enalapril 5 mg po q day.

7. Roxicet one teaspoon prn.
8. Megace 400 mg po q day.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.9, blood pressure
of 86/palp, heart rate in the 90s, respiratory rate 16,
sating well on room air.  In general, she is a thin female in
bed.  HEENT:  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.
Cardiovascular:  Sinus tachycardia, faint S1, S2.  Lungs:
Coarse breath sounds, otherwise clear.  Abdomen is soft with
mild tenderness.  Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of
10.6, hematocrit of 38.1, platelets of 310.  Sodium of 132,
potassium of 4.6, chloride 96, CO2 22, BUN of 27, creatinine
1.1.  Glucose 142, INR of 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  The patient was transferred to
the CCU from OMED for elective pericardial centesis.  A
pericardial centesis was performed by under normal
procedures, which removed immediately 600 mL of
serosanguinous fluid followed by an additional 4-500 cc over
the next 48 hours.

The pericardial drain was left in place until drainage was
less than 100 cc per day.  It was removed, and the patient
was transferred to the Medicine Service in good condition.
The patient's symptoms improved markedly with drainage of
pericardial effusion.  She remained in chronic asymptomatic
tachycardia, however, even after drainage of the effusion.

Oncology:  Patient and family decided at this time they did
not wish to undergo further chemotherapy and that she would
be made DNR/DNI, and brought home as a bridge to hospice.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Small cell lung cancer.
2. Pericardial effusion.
3. Pericardial tamponade.
4. Coronary artery disease.

time of admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] the patient denied any
fevers or chills, cough or sputum production, but noted
increasing weight loss. While at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 2063**]
the patient was found to have a small PE and was placed on
intravenous heparin.  He underwent multiple bronchoscopy
procedures, which resulted in his being intubated afterwards.
 He also was found to have a large abscess and multiple
secretions, which precluded extubation.  He had low
platelets, which was thought to be secondary to his overall
medical condition.  He was placed on multiple intravenous
antibiotics with minimal change in status.  He was also noted
to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation, which were
controlled with AV nodal blockers.  On [**2110-5-11**] the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for a left pneumonectomy of the necrotic left lung.
He was transferred on a ventilator and continued on
intravenous heparin.  He also developed hyperglycemia and was
controlled with NPH.

On [**2110-5-14**] the patient underwent surgery and had a left
extra pleural intrapericardial pneumonectomy, a pedicled
thoracic latissimus dorsi muscle flap, a pedicled omental
flap, a G tube placed, open tracheostomy tube placed, right
thoracoscopy tube placed and he also underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy with tracheal bronchial tree aspiration.  Mr.
[**Known lastname **] postoperative course was complicated by
cardiovascularly the patient required pressors for a short
period of time.  Pulmonary, the patient required continued
ventilation on AC, but later was switched over to pressure
support after a long period of trials.  His renal issues were
stable.  His ID issues, the patient was found to hve gram
negative rods on his sputum culture and he underwent multiple
antibiotic regimens.  The organisms were found to be
sensitive to Bactrim and he received a fourteen day course
for that.  Gastrointestinal, the patient received tube feeds
through his peg tube.  Heme/onc wise the patient required
transfusions immediately postoperative.  Endocrine wise, the
patient required an insulin sliding scale for his episodes of
hyperglycemia and neurologically the patient was
intermittently agitated, but was being sedated with Haldol,
Ativan and/or Morphine.

The main issue during Mr. [**Known lastname **] hospital stay was
difficulty weaning from his ventilator support.  After
numerous trials of gradually decreasing his pressure support
and PEEP on his ventilator the patient still required
increasing amounts of ventilatory support.  On chest x-ray he
was found to have a loculated pleural effusion on his right
side, which may have contributed to his weaning difficulties.
Overall, the patient remained in stable condition until the
afternoon of [**2110-6-24**] when the patient acutely
decompensated.  The patient was noted to have decreased urine
output and a drop in his systolic blood pressure into the 70s
and 80s.  He was unresponsive to fluid boluses.  The patient
was started on neo-synephrine and Levophed drips to support
his blood pressure and he received several liters of normal
saline boluses.

At about 8:00 p.m. on [**6-25**] the patient began complaining of
abdominal and chest pain and found to have right upper
quadrant tenderness on examination.  His [**Known lastname **] count was
found to be elevated at 23 and his hematocrit had fallen to
24.2.  The patient was cultured and a left subclavian line
and left arterial line was placed and Ativan drip was added
for sedation and comfort.  The patient also received 2 units
of packed red blood cells.  He then received an emergent
abdominal CT scan with contrast, which showed bilateral
pleural effusions, a rightward shift in his mediastinum,
large pericardial effusion, slight thickening of the cecal
wall, dilated colon with fluid and small pockets of free air
in the peritoneum, large amount of ascites and anasarca and a
suggestion of a calculus cholecystitis given the appearance
of the gallbladder on CT scan.  The patient was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics including Flagyl, Triazene and
Ampicillin.  He had an emergent cardiac echocardiogram
performed which initially showed a small circumferential
pericardial effusion, but later on review revealed tamponade
physiology of both the right and left ventricles and a large
loculated anterior pericardial effusion with right atrial and
right ventricular compression.

The patient because of his falling blood pressure was started
on vasopressin and hydrocortisone and morphine drip was added
for sedation.  The colorectal surgery attending who consulted
on the case felt that exploratory laparotomy would not
reverse his current situation and throughout the day of [**6-25**] the patient's condition continued to deteriorate.  The
patient required wide open pressors.  Both of his brothers
[**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 32342**] were contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding his condition and
decided to withdraw life support and provide comfort
measures, which was done.  The patient expired at
approximately 3:23 p.m. on [**2110-6-25**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiac arrest.
2.  Septic shock.
3.  Respiratory failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
67y/o M with h/o NSCLC s/p L pneumonectomy, admitted for workup
and treatment of a fnew right lung mass.
.
# Lung cancer - The patient was found to have a new right lung
mass, which was revealed to have small cell and non small cell
features on pathology.  The patient underwent a bronchoscopy by
interventional pulmonology to obtain the tissue diagnosis.  A
bone scan revealed diffuse osseous mets.  MRI was negative for
brain mets.  Chemotherapy (etoposide and carboplatin) was
initiated during this hospital course.  Neupogen was started 24h
after chemotherapy.  Further treatment is to be determined by
the patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], on followup as an
outpatient.
.
# mental status changes/hypotension - The patient had an episode
of acute mental status changes, unresponsiveness, and
hypotension which was likely multifactorial in etiology.  It was
likely partly due to medications (narcotic pain medications
among them) as well as a possible contribution of infection
(pneumonia as described below). There was no intracranial
hemorrhage by CT scan, no brain mets by recent MRI. Electrolytes
were within normal limits. The patient was found to be
hypercarbic, though it was difficult to say whether this is a
cause or result of MS changes. He was alert and oriented shortly
after arrival in the ICU.  Some of his pain medications were
then discontinued, and narcotics were used with caution for his
pain.  His antihypertensives were initally held, then restarted
once his blood pressure recovered.
.
# Hypercarbic resp failure: The patient had an elevated CO2 on
blood gas in association with the altered mental status and
hypotension described above.  This was likely secondary to
medication effect, with the respiratory failure being secondary
to sedation.  This improved as the patient became more awake.
.
# Pneumonia - The patient had a new RUL infiltrate on chest
xray, likely a postobstructive vs. aspiration pneumonia.  As he
was also hypotensive at the time (see above) vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and flagyl were all started.  Vanco was then
discontinued, and treatment with levo/flagyl was continued, with
a planned course of 10 days.
.
# abdominal pain - The patient presented with abdominal pain of
unclear etiology, and had a negative CT abd/pelvis at an outside
hospital. Possible etiologies included metastatic disease,
hypercalcemia, constipation, or a combination of these.  He was
given bowel regimen for constipation, treatment for
hypercalcemia as below, and pain medications.  He ultimately had
good control of his pain, as well as resolution of his
constipation.
.
# hypercalcemia - Calcium was 11.2 on admission, likely related
to the patient's malignancy.  This improved somewhat with
hydration and lasix, but remained above normal.  The patient
received a dose of pamidronate on [**2103-2-9**], after which the
calcium level remained normal.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit drifted downward slowly, and reached a
nadir of [**2109-3-1**] (this in the setting of IV
hydration). Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease (ferritin >[**2097**]). Stools were guaiac negative.  Some of
the decrease in hematocrit may also have been related to
chemotherapy.  The patient received a total of 3 units of PRBC
during the hospital course, after which his hct remained stable.

.
# DM: We continued metformin per home regimen, but discontinued
glipizide when blood glucose levels became too low.  We checked
QID fingersticks and covered with insulin sliding scale.  The
patient was on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na was 131 on [**2-20**].  This was likely
hypervolemic hyponatremia, in the setting of IVF and blood
products.  Sodium returned to [**Location 213**] after a small dose of
lasix.
.
# h/o CAD: Currently asymptomatic. Cardiac enzymes were negative
when checked in the ICU in the setting of hypotension and mental
status changes as above.  We continued his home regimen of beta
blocker, ACE inhibitor, aspirin, and statin.
.
# h/o depression: Paxil had been discontinued in [**Month (only) **], but
then was restarted at the outside hospital, and was continued
here.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 yo M with history of stage 4 NSCLC w/ mets to the
sternum who presents with fever, hemoptysis and SOB. Pt was
recently hospitalized in [**Month (only) **] at which time he had a talc
pleurodesis done on the left side due to malignant pleural
effusion. He was then discharged home on levofloxacin for
possible PNA for 10 days. Pt states he continued to have
persistent fevers despite the anitbiotics. On [**3-16**] he was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and at that time his chemo regimen was changed to
Tarceva after having failed both taxol/carboplatin and taxotere.
He said after starting this chemo he developed some diarrhea, no
N/V. He has had a persistent dry cough up until 2 days ago when
he noted hemoptysis and sputum production from his cough. Also
developed progressive SOB over the past few days with
fevers/chills. Cough is associated with right sided pleuritic
chest pain. He currently denies any N/V, CP, dysuria, focal
weakness, weight loss. Pt does have h/o of TB in right apices 50
yrs ago treated with INH and streptomycin along with chinese
herbal meds.
.
ONC History: Begins in [**2-11**] when pt was visiting his father in
[**Name (NI) 651**] and developed fever/cough.  At that time he had a CT scan
done which found a nodule in the LLL.  Pt then had this nodule
rescanned in [**Location (un) 86**] with subsequent scans that showed interval
increase in size.  He then underwent bronchoscopy and sampling
of pleural effusion  in [**11-11**] which demonstrated poorly
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  Staging PET scan
showed lesion in the sternum for metastatic disease.  He then
began chemotherapy with 2 cycles  [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with no response.
Switched to Taxotere for 2 cycles and once again no response,
then started on Tarceva on [**2107-3-16**].

CXR Interval progression of the left lower lobe opacity with
interval progression of bilateral upper lobe interstitial
opacities. These findings may be consistent with pulmonary edema
or changes related to radiation therapy. Lymphangitic spread of
tumor cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated, examination
with CT of the chest may be considered.

CTA Chest
1. Interval development of new extensive ground glass opacities
within the right upper lobe, patchy ground glass opacity within
the right middle lobe, and interval worsening of consolidation
within the left lower lobe with air bronchograms, findings all
of which suggest worsening multifocal pneumonia.
2. Relatively stable appearance of loculated small left pleural
effusion with enhancing and nodular thickening of the pleural
rim.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transfered to the ICU on HD #2 secondary to
increased hypoxia.  A chest xray revealed what appeared to be
multifocul pnuemonia.  Patient was kept on NRB mask overnight
however the next day patient continued to fatigue and after
discussion with the patient he was intubated.  Patient was
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of
pnuemonia even though no cultures came back positive.  He
continued to deteriorate while intubated and it was felt that he
went into ARDS based on his chest x-ray.  Patient was switched
to ARDSnet vent settings.  At one point patient became
hypotensive and had poor urine output.  He was started on
pressors which were able to be weaned off and his urine output
did improve slightly.  However is oxygenation requirements
continued to increase.  He was proned, and mutiple alveolar
recruitment efforts were tried for better oxygenation which only
produced minimal improvement.  After mutiple discussions with
the family they intitially wanted to continue with aggresive
treatment since the patient had one daughter in [**Name (NI) 651**] who the
family wanted to be present before the patient passed away.
However as the patient's oxygenation continued to deteriorate
even on maximal support his wife decided to stop aggresive
treatment and make patient comfort measures only.  Patient
expired soon after.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2164-5-23**] and taken to the operator
room for a left uncomplicated intrapericardial pneumonectomy. An
epidural was placed for pain control and the pt was followed
post operatively by the acute pain service. in the immed post op
period pt was placed on emperic vanco and zosyn pending pleural
fluid culture. Pleural fluid cuture grew out h.influenza
beta-lactamase positive. The vanco was d/c'd and she was
mainatained on zosyn. She remained afebrile and w/o
leukocytosis.  She transferred to the surgical intensive care
unit intubated, right and left chest tubes in place.  She was
hemodynamically stable.  On post-operative day one she was
extubated but during the course of the day developed respiratory
distress.  That evening she was re-intubated for pultiolet
including serial bronchoscopy for therapeutic aspiration. On
postoperative day 3 she did well and was successfully extubated.
She continue to do well and was transferred to the floor.

The left chest tube was d/c'd on POD #3
Daily cxr's were obtained and the left fluid level was followed
- at time of this summary it is just below the level of the
stump.Pleural fluid cuture grew out h.influenza beta-lactamase
positive. The vanco was d/c'd and she was mainatained on zosyn.
She remained afebrile and w/o leukocytosis.
On POD # 5 pt had a rise in her creat to 1.5 (from preop of .5).
Fena was .8. A renal consult was called and recommendations for
gentle hydration. Over the course of the next 3 days her creat
rose to a peak of 2.7 on POD# 7. On subsequent post op days her
creat began to drift down. At time of d/c her creat was 2.1.

At the time of d/c her pain was well controlled on fent patch
and po dilaudid. Her room air ambulatory sat was 95%. She was

Date of Birth:   [**2126-9-26**]     Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
female with a history of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
of the lung with diffuse metastases to the liver, pelvis, and
brain (status post carboplatin and Taxol radiation therapy
'Arissa') who was found to have brain metastases (status post
resection) in [**2175-2-14**] who had been recently started on
Navelbine salvage who presented on [**2175-4-10**] with
hypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation,
acute renal failure, and supraventricular tachycardia.

The patient's supraventricular tachycardia was responsive to
adenosine, and the patient was volume resuscitated in the
Emergency Department.  She was treated broadly with
ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and was admitted to the
Feniard Intensive Care Unit.

The patient's hypotension resolved overnight and was thought
largely secondary to volume depletion and possibly sepsis.
At that time, she was made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] mental status was intermittent and
confused.  She was transferred to the floor where she
improved for a few days.

On [**4-12**], she developed agitation and further confusion;
requiring Haldol.  The patient was noted to develop stridor
and tachycardia.  Multiple nebulizer treatment were tried
without affect.  The patient was given Benadryl 25 mg p.o.
times two and Cogentin 2 mg times two for suspected laryngeal
dystonia from Haldol.  The patient was given Pepcid 20 mg
intravenously times one and dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously
for a potential allergic reaction with no improvement.  The
patient was unable to speak secondary to distress.

Ear/Nose/Throat was consulted and found no upper airway
obstruction and normal cords.  The patient was admitted to
the Feniard Intensive Care Unit for a trial of [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed in
[**2173-4-16**] with three right upper lobe lesions; treated
with Taxol and carboplatin.  The patient was found to have
new lung nodules, liver metastases, and pelvis metastases in
[**2174-5-16**].  She was given radiation therapy and then
Arissa.   Over the course of [**2174-9-16**] to [**2175-9-16**] the patient was found to have increasing liver function
tests and noted to have worsening liver metastases.  In [**2175-1-14**], she was found to have brain metastases and underwent
right frontal lobe resection with two smaller metastases
remaining in [**2175-2-14**].  The patient was started on
Navelbine salvage.
2.  Reactive airway disease and emphysema.
3.  Right thyroidectomy for colloid nodule.
4.  Iron deficiency anemia.
5.  Gastritis with Helicobacter pylori.
6.  Depression.
7.  History of abnormal PAP smear.
8.  History of whole body image.
9.  History of axillary abscess.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Atrovent meter-dosed inhalers.
 2.  Haldol 0.5 mg p.o. twice per day as needed.
 3.  Neutra-Phos two packets p.o. three times per day.
 4.  Sucralfate 1 g four times per day.
 5.  Dapsone 4 mg intravenously twice per day.
 6.  Iron 325 mg p.o. once per day.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 20-pack-year history of
smoking.  Occasional alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Brain cancer, thyroid cancer, coronary
artery disease, hypertension, and asthma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 98, blood pressure was 150/70,
respiratory rate was 28, heart rate was 125, and oxygen
saturation was 92% on 4 liters.  Generally, the patient was
an ill-appearing female in moderate respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
extraocular movements were intact.  Mucous membranes were
dry.  Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy.  Audible
stridor on expiration was heard.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed tachycardia.  Normal first heart sounds and second
heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs were
clear with the exception of decreased breath sounds up to
halfway up the right lung field and one quarter of the way up
the left lung field.  The abdomen was firm, distended, and
nontender with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremity
examination revealed no edema.  On neurologic examination,
the patient was acutely agitated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratory findings revealed the patient had a white blood
cell count of 12.3, hematocrit was 33.1, and platelets were
163.  INR was 2.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 144,
potassium was 3.7, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 19,
blood urea nitrogen was 28, creatinine was 0.8, and blood
glucose was 129.  Anion gap was 17.  The patient had a
fibrinogen of 143.  D-dimer was greater than [**2171**].  FBE was
80 to 160.  ALT was 213, AST was 737, alkaline phosphatase
was 497, and total bilirubin was 2.9.  Calcium was 7.8,
phosphate was 2.3, and magnesium was 2.6.  Lactate was 12.5.
Free calcium was 1.15.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  On chest x-ray the patient had
a large right pleural effusion with a question of left lower
lobe atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 48-year-old female with a
history of poorly differentiated lung cancer with diffuse
metastases to the liver, pelvis, and brain; status post
carboplatin, Taxol, radiation therapy, Arissa, and metastases
resection (on Navelbine salvage) who presented with
hypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation,
acute renal failure, and lactic acidosis who now returned to
the Feniard Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory
distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with a question of acute
stridor with an unchanged chest x-ray.

The differential diagnosis initially included a dystonic
reaction from Haldol or an allergic reaction.  However, the
patient did not respond to Cogentin, Benadryl, steroids, or
H2 blockers; and Ear/Nose/Throat ruled out any upper airway
swelling or laryngeal spasms.

Thus, it was thought that the patient had a fixed
obstruction; perhaps some lymph nodes or lung cancer which
became clinically evident as wheezing or stridor in the
setting of increased mini-ventilation from progressive
metabolic acidosis.  Heliox was attempted without success,
and the patient was started on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure with no real improvement in her symptoms.  She was
not any more responsive on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure
and required morphine for some sedation to enable her to work
with the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.  Her respiratory
status did not improve clinically.

2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with mental status
changes in the setting of diffusely metastatic breast cancer
with liver involvement and hepatic encephalopathy as well as
hypoxia and worsening acidosis with hypercarbia.  Her mental
status did not improve despite the aggressive measures in the
Intensive Care Unit.

3.  GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  The patient with rapidly
progressive liver failure; likely secondary to metastatic
non-small-cell lung cancer with diffuse involvement.
Progressive metabolic lactic acidosis was likely secondary to
hepatic failure.

4.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient with metastatic
lung cancer diffusely spread to liver, [**Hospital1 500**], and brain.
Nearing the end-stage on salvage Navelbine.  The patient had
ongoing evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
The overall prognosis, according to the patient's primary
oncologist, was uniformly poor.

5.  CODE ISSUES:  The patient presented with progressive lung
cancer diffusely metastatic which was refractory to multiple
chemotherapeutic regimens, brain metastases resection, and
radiation therapy.  She developed worsening respiratory
failure in the setting of progressive lactic acidosis,
pleural effusions, respiratory acidosis, and altered mental
status.

After discussing the patient's uniformly poor prognosis with
her oncologist, as well as her husband (who was her health
care proxy), the decision was made to make the patient
comfort measures only.  The patient expired with family at
the bedside.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory failure.
2.  Poorly differentiated metastatic non-small-cell lung
cancer.
3.  Progressive metabolic lactic acidosis.
4.  Right pleural effusion.
5.  Liver failure.
6.  Acute renal failure.
7.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
8.  Supraventricular tachycardia.
9.  Reactive airway disease.

Service:  THORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
male who was first noted to have bilateral lung masses on a
chest x-ray in preparation for possible sinus surgery.  A
follow-up CAT scan of the chest in [**2166-3-26**] originally had
shown a 6.5 cm left upper lobe mass and a 3.5 cm lobulated
right upper lobe mass.  He consequently underwent
fluoroscopic biopsy of the right-sided mass which showed
adenocarcinoma.  Bronchial biopsy of the left upper lobe
showed poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with
squamous differentiation.  Metastatic work-up of the head,
bone, and abdomen was negative.  His laboratory studies
remained relatively normal.

He was seen by the Oncology Service and started on
chemotherapy.  The follow-up imaging showed marked regression
of his tumor.  He was consequently referred to Thoracic
Surgery for a possible surgical intervention.  The patient
has not lost significant weight and has not had any fevers,
headaches, or chest pain.  He has had good appetite

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.  3.  Nasal polyps.  4.  Bilateral lung
carcinoma.  5.  Chronic maxillary and ethmoid sinusitis.  6.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Lipitor 10 mg
q.d., Atrovent, Vanceril, antihistamines for allergies.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Likely asbestos exposure.  History of
smoking (60 pack years).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Well-developed, in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric.  No lymphadenopathy
palpated.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:
Regular, rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Pulses present
bilaterally.  Warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit 38,
platelet count 351; BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, sodium 141,
potassium 3.9, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 28; liver
function tests within normal limits; FEV1 was 44% of the
predicted value.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the diagnosis of bilateral lung
cancer, Thoracic Surgery was consulted.  On [**2166-9-5**],
the patient underwent median sternotomy, left upper
lobectomy, bronchoscopy, pedicled pericardial flap, right
upper wedge resection, and decortication of the left lung.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
immediate complications.  Please see the full operative
report for details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
fair condition.  He had to be reintubated and maintained on
pressure support.  He was transfused with 2 U of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.6.  Chest x-ray obtained
at that time, showed left lower lobe collapse/consolidation
but appeared relatively unchanged.  The patient underwent a
series of therapeutic bronchoscopies during his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit.  It showed mucous plugging and thick
secretions.  He had an increased need of Neo requirement.
The patient was weaned of sedation.  His chest x-ray showed
some interval improvement.

He continued to have low-grade fevers.  He was placed on
Ceftriaxone and Kefzol.  His hematocrit remained stable.
There was some difficulty weaning him off of pressure
support.  In addition, his tube feeding was initiated.  He
continued to have thick oral secretions.  He remained in
sinus rhythm but had an eight-beat run of ventricular
tachycardia was noted.  The patient was started on Amiodarone
drip.  He was transfused again with one unit of red blood
cells.  The patient was successfully extubated on
postoperative day #4.

He was transferred to the red floor on postoperative day #5
in stable condition.  He continued to produce good urine.  He
remained in sinus rhythm.  He continued to be afebrile with
stable blood pressure and heart rate.  Physical Therapy was
consulted which recommended rehabilitation facility upon
discharge.

The chest tubes were removed.  The patient was discharged to
the rehabilitation facility on [**2166-9-16**].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
70 yo female with a hx of small cell lung CA s/p RUL resection
recently started on taxotere, COPD, bronchitis admitted for
cough and hypoxia in clinic. Pt began experiencing cough and
sputum production on [**9-7**] although d/c summary from previous
hospitalization reported 2-3wk hx of weakness and SOB. Pt
reported cough intially productive of green sputum. She denied
any fever or chills, recent sick contacts. Pt went to clinic 1
and appeared tachypneic and was sent to the ED. Pt was admitted
initially for brochitis vs PNA and started on MDI's and
levofloxacin. Chest CT revealed no infiltrate suggestive of PNA
and she was easily weaned off of oxygen overnight so antibiotics
were stopped. Interventional pulmonary team was consulted since
the mass impinging on the rt main stem bronchus appeared larger,
but no intervention made since it was lesss that 80% obstructed
and unlikely the cause of hypoxia. Pt was dischaged on [**9-9**]
without antibiotics and off of o2. Pt continued to be short of
breath at home and continued cough productive of brown sputum.
No fevers or chills were present, but reported diarrhea prior to
and throughout her hospitalization w/o melena or hematochezia.
Pt denied PND, but had orthopnea and reported new LE edema,
although pt has no hx of CHF and echo from [**9-18**] was normal. Pt
presented to clinic on [**9-11**] for taxotere tx but med was held
due to poor PO intake, diarrhea, and weakness and instead was
given 1L IVF. She came back to clinic for 2U PRBC transfusion
for low Hct and found to have temp to 100.2 O2 Sats of 90% [**Female First Name (un) **]
which only improved to 94% on 2 L so she was given 125mg of
solumedrol for COPD flare vs PNA.


Past Medical History:
1. SCLCA (stage IIIA) hx-found to have lung mass on CXR after
syncopal episode in [**2-17**], trqnsbronchial bx revealed SCLCA and
she started taxol/carboplatin induction with rad tx in [**3-18**]
followed by gemcitibine with RUL resection in [**7-20**]. CA found to

for partial pseudomonas coverage on, and postobstructive PNA and
completed 14 day regimen although flagyl dced on day 5 for
possiblity of lowering the seizure threshold and clindamycin
added on day #8. Pt wheeze continued on PE although she has a hx
of obstructive pulmonary disease so was treated with stress dose
IV solumedrol 60mg intially which was titrated up to 6mg
dexamethasone IV q6 hours per neuro after bleeding brain
metastasis found. Pt has partially obstructing lesion of rt main
stem bronchus which appeared larger on repeat chest CT and may
be cause of wheeze, although held on interventional pulomary at
this time. Pt had video swallow to rule out aspiration which was
negative, but S and S recommeded having meds in applesauce and
swallowing twice with all food consistencies. She was continued
on standing MDI's of fluticasone and combivent with albuterol
nebulizer treatments prn.
2. NSCLCA-Held taxotere therapy since pt was acutely ill. Hct
remained stable so we discontinued her outpatient procrit.
Bleeding in brain initially thought to be embolic although MRI
was more suggestive of bleeding metastasis. Kept all options
open so Neuro/Onc consulted and made plan for stereotactic
radioablation and have pt seen in tumor clinic. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1844**].
Fusion MRI obtained per Neuro/Onc.
3. Change in mental status- Nature of course of mental status
change felt to be due to seizure per neuro and not hemmorhagic
stroke. Pt has no focal neurologic exam findings except for mild
left eye and mouth droop at rest and cont hyprereflexic patellar
and achilles on left, but no loss of strength. Pt initially on
Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis which had been switched [**9-24**]
to Keppra now titraed up to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **].
4. Thrombocytopenia-Initial fall in platelets thought to be due
to platelet clumping and repeat sample in citrate tube suggests
pseudothrombocytopenia. HIT ab sent and held on all heparin use.
Continued to do platelet checks in citrate tube wtih stable
levels.
4. HTN-BP stable and pt started on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for unclear reason so changed back her outpatient Zestril 5mg qd
when transferred back to floor. Pt remains hypertensive with
stable creatinine so titrated up Zestril to 10mg qd.
5. Back pain-Pt with known t4 compression fracture which
coincides with her area of pain. Fracture not thought to be
malignant. Hydrocodone changed to standing oxycontin now
titrated up to 20mg q12 and oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
6. Depression-Pt mood improved and continued on outpatient
Celexa dose.
7. Hypothyroidism-Cont on outpatient dose levothyroxine
 8.Oral thrush-due to high dose steroids. Cont to treat with
nystatin swish and swallow initially but changed to oral
fluconazole.
9. FEN-House diet, cont megace to improve appetite, replete
lytes
10. Px- Pneumoboots, PPI, on agressive bowel regimen
12. Code-DNR/DNI

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2180-4-8**] - Following transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital, patient
arrived on medical floor and was found to be in rapid afib with
rate around 150 bpm with SBP 112. He was given 50 mg of PO
metoprolol which per floor team he aspirated. After that pt
developed new hypoxia with sats down to 89% on RA with return to
95% on 2L. Pt was then given 5 mg IV metoprolol with out change
in heart rate. Pt was then left in his room briefly. At this
point he got up out of bed and pulled out his foley catheter
with the ballon inflated. Approximately 300cc blood were found
in the bed side comode. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for rapid
afib, hypoxia, bleeding, and hypercalcemia.
.
Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt in rapid afib with SBP in the 90s. He
was bolused with fluids prn and started on an amiodarone gtt
that was quickly converted to oral. His beta-blocker was
restarted and titrated up to 50mg tid w/out conversion of his
rhythm. He had an equivocal speech and swallowing study. He was
placed on thick liquids following a video swallow study that was
concerning for aspiration. He was seen by thoracics who remained
unwilling to intervene to sample tissue until his cardiac issues
were better controlled. Ophthalmology signed off on the patient
following an MRI that revealed no retroorbital mass to cause his
left proptosis and a resolution of his ocular findings with
continued use of erythromycin ointment. After the above
management, he remained afebrile & normotensive. With his
cardiac issues stabilized, he was sent for mediastinoscopy.
.
In the pre-op holding area, anesthesia noted his respiratory
rate to be in the 30s w/increased work of breathing and
diagnosed CHF. He was given 40mg of lasix and a MICU bed was
requested. In this second ICU stay, his respiratory failure was
treated with bi-pap resulting in improved O2sat's and arterial
blood gas results.
.
He returned to the floor and had an O2 saturation in the 90's on
3L nasal cannula. While on the floor, he was found to be
bradycardic (30's) and unresponsive with a O2Sat in the 60's. A
code blue was called, and the patient was intubated by the
responding anesthesia team. He was transferred to the MICU where
his course included respiratory failure likely secondary to
mucus plugging & collapse of the right lung in the setting of
CHF and pleural effusions. He was intubated and bronchoscopy was
performed which aspirated copious obstructing secretions and a
bronchial lavage grew oropharyngeal flora. Patient was shortly
extubated without complication. All antiarrhythmics were
stopped. Patient's cardiorespiratory status improved, repeat
chest xray demonstrated expansion of the collapsed right lung.
.
Patient returned to the floor from MICU stay with relative
volume overload. He remained alert & oriented X 3. Hct dropped 3
points in setting of this ICU stay, found to have right thigh
hematoma at site of femoral venous line placement.
Abdominopelvic CT showed confinement of the hematoma to the
thigh. Follow-up exams showed no signs of expansion of the
hematoma, hct remained stable, and there were no signs of
compartment syndrome noted. Beta-blockade was reinstituted, but
amiodarone was held. Diuresis was continued with 40mg IV lasix
[**Hospital1 **] & 1L fluid restriction with goal of -1L per day. Patient
responded with effective diuresis and improvement in clinical
hypervolemia. Respiratory status improved and pulmonary exam in
combination with chest xray showed decreasing signs of pulmonary
edema and effusions. Given continued lack of definitive
diagnosis regarding mediastinal lymphadenopathy for which the
patient was admitted, radiology was consulted regarding
CT-guided biopsy per thoracic surgery recommendations. A CTA was
performed with bicarbonate prophylaxis against contrast-induced
nephropathy. Radiology determined that the lymphadenopathy was
not amenable to CT-guided biopsy. Thoracic surgery was again
consulted and at that time agreed for plan of mediastinoscopy on
[**2180-5-3**] following several more days of diuresis. Thoracic
surgery also recommended ultrasound-guided thoracentesis of
right pleural effusion to improve respiratory status
pre-operatively. The procedure team was unable to perform the
thoracentesis as there was no safe entry point for thoracentesis
bilaterally due to a reported relatively high risk of
pneumothorax by ultrasound, though a significant pleural
effusion was noted.
.
Following improvement in the patient's upper and lower extremity
edema in addition to bilateral pleural effusion following
diuresis, the patient underwent Right anterior mediastinotomy
w/flexible bronchoscopy on [**2180-5-3**]. His systolic pressure was in
the 70's for a brief period during the procedure, which required
phenylephrine and 1L of fluids intraoperatively. He tolerated
extubation well following the procedure, but was sent to the
MICU for hypoxia and hypercarbia postoperatively. He was placed
on bi-pap in the MICU with improvement in ABG results. He
returned to the floor the following day ([**2180-5-4**]). His foley
catheter was removed that evening, and he was able to void
250cc's over several attempts on the morning of [**2180-5-5**]. He
remained afebrile and normotensive with an O2 saturation of
91-95% on 1.5L O2. Postoperatively, his hct remained stable. He
experienced a slight elevation in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.5 one
day postoperatively, with a decrease to 1.4 on the 2nd day after
surgery.
.
Briefly, this is an 82 year old man with a PMH of CHF & chronic
renal insufficiency admitted for tissue diagnosis by
mediastinoscopy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the setting of
symptomatic hypercalcemia whose course was complicated by
multiple ICU stays for atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response, congestive heart failure and hypercarbic
respiratory failure and aspiration.
.
1) Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Patient does not
have previous diagnosis of COPD, but has 45 year history of
smoking.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions may be due to
CHF or may be secondary to suspected malignancy. Previous ICU
stay for hypoxic respiratory failure was found to be secondary
to mucous plug with right lung collapse that improved following
evacuation of mucous plug by suction through endotracheal tube.
Most likely etiology for most recent respiratory compromise is
secondary to volume given at surgery as well as sedation. Goal
Co2 60s (baseline 50s-60s due to COPD). Pt's CO2 slightly
improved w/ BiPap, but pt refused to wear it after 3am [**5-4**].
Still hypercarbic in 80s at 9am on [**5-4**]. Pt comfortable on room
air with oxygen saturation ~95% at 5/25 afternoon.
- Goal for patient was to maintain O2 saturation in low 90s to
maintain respiratory drive.
.
2) Hypercalcemia & mediastinal lymphadenopathy work-up: The
patient had his w/u started at the outside hospital. His chest
CT showed mediatinal LAD and a bone marrow bx showed 3% clonal
population suggestive of lymphoma.  His PTHrp was normal and
SPEP/UPEP negative.  Of note, he has a history of taking a large
number of herbal remedies at home, some of which included
calcium and vitamin D as ingredients.  Endocrinology team
thought his herbal remedies were contributory in regard to his
hypercalcemia, but did not explain the extreme degree of
elevation. He was bolused with fluid and given calcitonin w/
improvement of his mental status and normalization of his serum
calcium.  He is underwent surgical lymph node sampling sd above.
S/p mediastinoscopy & bronchoscopy - widened mediastinum most
likely from lymphoma, but awaiting pathology results for
confirmation.
- counseled patient regarding avoidance of herbal remedies
- f/u pending pathology
- 'mediastinal fluid growing GNR' per initial Micro report, but
clarified with Micro and Surgery that fluid is pleural fluid,
and GNR is actually debris and not true bacteria per final
microbiology report.
- f/u blood ctx
- 500 keflex q12hrs per thoracic surgery (slight erythema at
wound edge, no drainage, pain)
.
3) Pancytopenia - Current Hct 26.2. He has required multiple
transfusions of pRBC's both secondary to ICU stays (bleeding
following self-removal of inflated foley as well as right thigh
hematoma following femoral vein TLC placement). He received 2
units of pRBC's preoperatively as well. Hct has been stable
postoperatively. Reticulocyte count of 2.3, which is low in
setting of his anemia. Currently with increasing plts (152),
considered HIT but not likely given a negative HIT antibody and
negative serotonin release antibody. Slowly decreasing WBC count
during admission, but now stable at 3.3 to 4.3 over last week.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Possibly related to suspected lymphoma, but bone marrow
aspiration from outside hospital showed normocellular bone marow
with erythroid hyperplasia (despite 3% clonal B cells). Chronic
renal insufficiency with low Epo may be contributing, have not
yet checked Epo levels.
- transfuse for hct less than 21
- follow counts, awaiting mediastinal path results
- recommend checking Epo levels as outpatient with
supplementation as needed
.
4) CHF - Patients recent echo with LVEF 70% however severe 3+ MR
calls into question the clinical utility of this measurement,
pulmonary edema on CXR, persistent bilateral effusions.  Right
effusion drained of 500cc's during mediastinoscopy with
improvement in f/u chest Xray. Goal for patient over last
several days was to maintain O2 saturation in low 90s to
maintain respiratory drive and mild diuresis with -500cc
negative per day. At time of discharge, patient considered
euvolemic vs slightly hypovolemic.
- Goal to maintain current fluid status and weight
- Strict I/O, goal for neutral to -500cc daily fluid balance
- Fluid restrict to 1L/day
- Consider lasix 80mg po qd if does not maintain euvolemia
- Consider follow-up echocardiogram as outpatient considering
valvular disease
.
5) Atrial Fibrillation - Recent onset and unclear if has ever
happened before. It was associated with hypotension initially on
the floor and this prompted ICU transfer.  In the ICU, he was
amiodarone loaded and started on metoprolol before call out to
the floor.  On the floor, the patient converted to NSR w/
increases in his metoprolol dosage but was mildly bradycardic
upon conversion to the high 40s/low 50s.  He maintained his BP
despite this bradycardia.  Cardiology was consulted at the
request of thoracic surgery and they recommended lowering both
his amiodarone and metoprolol doses in the setting of his
bradycardia.  He was being fluid resuscitated as below but was
stable on transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for mediastinoscopy.  An
echocardiogram done in the setting of his new afib showed 3+
MR/TR. He had three further ICU stays on [**Hospital Ward Name **], and his
amiodarone was discontinued secondary to a bradycardic episode
that was the precipitant of one of these ICU stays. Telemetry
was discontinued on day prior to discharge.
- rate controlled on beta blocker
- back on coumadin, INR 1.1, continue to follow INR; goal INR
[**1-14**].
.
6) Renal Failure - The pt had some history over weeks of acute
on chronic renal failure. This was thought to be related to
hypercalcemia and improved on the floor w/ IVF.  In the 2 days
prior to transfer, his mucus membranes appeared dry and his UOP
dropped w/ resultant creatinine increase.  Urine lytes at that
time were consistent with a prerenal picture and he was bolused
with IVF.  He received IV fluids in the setting of hypotension
and multiple ICU stays during this hospitalization, requiring
diuresis upon return to the floor for volume overload and
worsening CHF. The patient's creatinine is currently 1.4, which
is at baseline
- Avoid over-diuresis
- Avoid obstructive symptoms with medical treatment of prostatic
hypertrophy
.
7) Urethral trauma - After he pulled out his foley while the
balloon was inflated, he was noted to have bleeding from his
urethra and his HCT dropped 3 pts acutely. This resolved with no
further bleeding. Post foley removal the patient had difficulty
with urination, he will need to be straight cath'd qshift and if
the urinary retention does not resolve, he will need to f/u with
his urologist.
.
8) Left eye swelling - The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with about
10 day history of left eye swelling and conjunctival erythema.
He was evaluated by opthalmology who gave an initial
differential diagnosis to include conjunctivitis vs orbital
metastasis. CT of the head showed subdural bleed vs
calcification (calcification felt to be most likely after
repeat) which was followed by another f/u CT per neurosurgery 10
days later which confirmed that there was no evidence of
intracranial bleeding.  MRI showed no retroorbital mass or AVM
to produce his symptoms.  He was treated w/ erythromycin
ointment and he was improving on transfer. Per ophthalmology,
diagnosis is idiopathic inflammatory conjunctivitis.
- continue erythromycin
.
9) FEN - The patient had a questionable aspiration event and was
evaluated by a swallowing video.  This test was somewhat
equivocal and he is on a  thickened liquids and ground solids,
cardiac & renal diet, patient agrees to use
swallow-cough-swallow technique to avoid aspiration.
Recommendations were for thick liquids with small amounts of
thin liquids between meals, but patient insists upon taking thin
liquids. Crush all pills.
.
10) Prophylaxis
- PPI, bowel regimen, tylenol, pneumoboots/TEDs, sc heparin
being held out of concern for HIT (serotonin release assay
pending)

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2132-4-1**] 9:01 AM
FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the
appearance of the present noncontrast head CT scan compared to
the prior [**Hospital3 **] study of [**2131-11-11**], as well as the
outside study from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. There is no sign for
the presence of a visible intracranial mass lesion. Both studies
show slightly asymmetric atrophy of the cerebellum, more evident
in the region of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Images of the
cerebellum, at this time, are moderately degraded by patient
motion. In any case, visualization of the MR- described
cavernous hemangioma would be extremely difficult, given its
reported small size and typically limited visibility on a
noncontrast head CT scan. The surrounding osseous and soft
tissue structures show no additional abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: No interval change from prior study of [**2131-11-11**]. In view of the questions you have raised in the history,
kindly forward the original report of the [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital CT scan for our independent review.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2132-4-3**] 8:11 AM
CT ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS:
The main right and left, lobar and proximal segmental pulmonary
arteries are widely patent and appear normal, no evidence of
acute pulmonary embolus. At the peripheral segmental level the
contrast opacification is slightly suboptimal.
Normal heart size and central pulmonary arterial vasculature.
Normal caliber thoracic aorta.
Patient is status post right upper lobectomy. Small right
posterior basal pleural effusion. Partial atelectasis of the
medial segment of the right middle lobe.
Patchy consolidation in the posterior aspect of the right lower
lobe also patchy airspace consolidation in the posterior portion
of left lower lobe. There is associated increased ground-glass
attenuation in these areas more marked on the left lung.
Differential possibilities include aspirational pneumonia.
Although the appearances were asymmetric, worse on the left
side, asymmetric pulmonary oedema is also a consideration.
However, the nondependent interlobular septae in the right lung
do not appear thickened at present.
Minor area of residual localized pneumothorax in the central
medial thorax.
No bone lesions demonstrated.
In the arterial phase scan, there is an ill-defined area of
hypodensity in the posteromedial aspect of segment VII (series
4, image 100) which remains unchanged in size compared to prior
CT of [**2131-11-12**].
CONCLUSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolus demonstrated.
2. Extensive patchy consolidation in the left lung and posterior
aspect of the remaining right lower lobe with associated
ground-glass attenuation in those areas. Differential
considerations include aspiration pneumonia possibly with some
associated and asymmetric pulmonary edema. Small localized right
posterior basal pleural effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2132-4-8**] 11:02 AM
The patient is status post partial resection of the right lung
with volume loss and a persistent small right apical
pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. There are bibasilar
areas of consolidation, left greater than right, which appear
worsened in the interval. Small right pleural effusion is
without change.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving bibasilar pneumonia.
2. Small right apical pneumothorax.

Bronchial lavage [**2132-4-4**]:
  ATYPICAL.
  Rare isolated atypical cells, can not exclude malignancy.
  Neutrophils, histiocytes and red blood cells.

Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 111712**]  4 R/L LOWER PARATRACHEAL,2 R
UPPER PARATRACHEAL,7
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Parietal pleura (A):
Fragments of lung and pleura with focal fibrosis.
Note:  By immunohistochemistry, the aggregates of cells present
are negative for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2), S-100,
HMB-45, and MART-1.  Calretinin is weakly positive in the
mesothelial cells present.
II.  Right upper lobe, wedge resection (B-J):
Malignant melanoma (1.0 cm), see note.
Note:  Sections show a monotypic population of atypical spindled
and epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli, arranged in
nodules and small nests.  By immunohistochemistry, these cells
are positive for S-100 and MART-1; they are negative for
cytokeratin cocktail, 34BE12, synaptophysin, chromogranin and
TTF1. This immunophenotype supports the diagnosis of malignant
melanoma.
III.  Lung, right upper lobectomy (K-R):
1.  Bronchial and vascular margins with no malignancy.
2.  Lung parenchyma with emphysematous changes and vascular
congestion; no malignancy identified.
3.  Pleural fibrosis.
 IV.  Lymph node, level 9, pulmonary ligament (S):
Two lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/2).
  V.  Lymph node, level 10, hilar (T):
One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
 VI.  Lymph node, level 11, interlobar (U):
One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
VII.  Lymph node, level 12, lobar (V):
One lymph node with no malignancy identified (0/1).
Clinical: Right upper lobe nodule.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is an 81 year-old gentleman with NSCLC diagnosed in
[**2134-9-29**] s/p combination radiation and chemotherapy (with
carboplatin and taxol, last dose in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**]) who presented
to the ED complaining of severe dyspnea on exertion for the past
week PTA.  The pt. stated that he becomes short of breath when
he walks approximately 10 feet which is a change from his
baseline.  He has also noticed associated weakness, fatigue and
decreased oral intake secondary to loss of appetite.  He was
evaluated by his radiation oncologist who noted that he
desaturated to ~90% on room air with any exertion and was
advised to report to the ED to rule-out pulomary embolus.  On
presentation, the pt. denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, fever, chills, BPBPR,
or any changes in his bowel or bladder habits. He stated that he
has been constipated since beginning chemotherapy.

In the ED, his vital signs were T: 98.7F, P: 64, R: 24, BP:
84/45, SaO2: 100% on 4liters via nasal cannula.  He received 5
liters of normal saline with minimal response in his blood
pressure.  Accordingly a MICU evaluation was performed and the
pt. was judged to be appropriate for MICU based on the need for
pressors.  In the ED, the pt. also received IV levofloxacin,
metronidazole, and ceftazadime for pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia/Sepsis: Pt was admitted for post-obstructive
pneumonia. Pt was initially transferred to the ICU for
hypotension requiring pressors (levophed) and total of 7 L of
IVF.  He was started on Ceftaz, levofloxacin, and metronidazole,
but was later tailored to Levo/Flagyl.  His Toprol was held in a
setting of hypotension and he was stabilized and was transferred
to the floor where his oxygenation improved by HD #5 where he
was breathing well on room air.  He will be discharged with
total of 14 day course of Levo/Flagyl.

2. Dyspnea: Pt with no known CHF, hx of a-fib.  Pt noted to have
pulmonary edema on CXr and increased UE and LE edema after
aggressive fluid resusscitation with 7 L of IVF.  Pt was gently
diuresed with lasix, spironolactone.  Pt became slightly
alkalotic from contraction so Diamox was given for alkalosis.
Echo was done which showed with EF 50-55%, mild hypokinesis of
LV wall, no MR, no pericardial effusion.  Pt has a baseline LE
edema from chronic venous stasis.

3. Pancytopenia: secondary to recent chemotherapy.  Pt got
Neupogen with the goal of WBC>2.0.  WBC peaked at 19.5.  WBC
count on discharge was 14.3.

4. Thrombocytopenia: Plt count on admission was 137 and steadily
dropped to 51.  HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued
and HIT antibody was sent.  The result is pending at the time of
discharge.  His platelet count stabilized at 54 at the time of
discharge.  He will have the VNA check CBC and have the result
faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  If the HIT antibody comes back positive, pt
was instructed to return to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment with
meds such as argatroban.

5. Atrial fibrillation: Pt was continued on digoxin but his home
Toprol was held due to hypotension.  Pt was discharged with his
regular digoxin and half the dose of Toprol he was taking at
home.

months following the patient's hospitalization since the
resident assigned to dictate the discharge summary did not
complete it.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 59 year old
woman who is an intermittent smoker and suffers from chronic
renal failure with three previous renal transplants.  The
etiology of her renal failure is unknown and the last
transplant seems to be working well.  She had been followed
for chest x-rays which showed nodules in the right lower lobe
which were increasing in size.  A needle biopsy was positive.
A PET scan showed positivity in the area and operation was
advised.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant for diabetes mellitus induced by Prednisone.
2.  Previous kidney transplants.
3.  Previous wedge resection for Aspergillus through a right
thoracotomy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Kidney transplants.
2.  Two total hip replacements.
3.  Right thoracotomy.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Rapamune.
2.  Prednisone.
3.  Caltrate,.
4.  Pravachol.
5.  Lopressor.
6.  Estrace.
7.  Provera.
8.  Fosamax.
9.  Insulin.
10. Percocet.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her review of systems was significant for
a slight nervousness but was otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, she was afebrile and
in no acute distress with a pulse of 74 and a blood pressure
of 150/100.  Lung fields were clear with a previous right
thoracotomy.  Cardiac examination:  Revealed regular rhythm
without extra sounds or murmurs.

On the day of admission, I performed a bronchoscopy,
mediastinoscopy revealing negative nodes, a right
thoracostomy and a limited right thoracotomy with resection
of the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  This
revealed early stage squamous cell carcinoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Postoperatively, the patient did well.
There was no significant air leak and the chest tubes were
able to be removed on the second postoperative day.  The
patient completed rehabilitation and was discharged on the
fourth postoperative day on her usual medication as well as
pain medications.

Follow-up was arranged.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 67-year-old woman with a
history of atrial fibrillation and newly-diagnosed non-small
cell lung cancer with left main stem bronchus occlusion by
bronchoscopy, is transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for
further management.
The patient has had several months of chronic cough and
increased dyspnea on exertion.  She also has
treatment-refractory atrial fibrillation (with difficulty
with rate and rhythm control, being evaluated at [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital).  A V/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism was
done as a workup for atrial fibrillation, and revealed marked
decreased ventilation of the left lung. A follow-up CT of the
main stem bronchus with extensive mediastinal extension was
discovered.  A bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**12-13**]
revealed a soft tissue endobronchial lesion causing greater
than 90% occlusion of the left main stem bronchus as well as
extrinsic compression of the carina and extension to the
right main stem bronchus.  An initial biopsy revealed results
consistent with non-small cell lung cancer.

At the time of transfer, the patient has mild dyspnea at
rest, significant dyspnea on exertion.  Oxygen saturations
are 92 to 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Her atrial
fibrillation is rate controlled in the 80s and 90s.  She is
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
attempt at rigid bronchoscopy to open the left main stem
bronchus.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation diagnosed two years ago
2.  Non-smell cell lung cancer as above
3.  History of positive PPD, negative acid fast bacilli on
bronchoscopy
4.  History of thyroid surgery

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Digoxin 0.25 mg once daily,
Flecainide 100 mg twice a day, albuterol metered dose inhaler
every two hours as needed, DuoNeb aerosols every four hours,
fluticasone 220 mcg two puffs twice a day, brimonidine
ophthalmic solution, Diltiazem 60 mg every eight hours,
Synthroid 0.075 mcg once daily, montelukast 10 mg once daily,
Protonix 40 mg once daily, Ativan intravenously as needed.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  Allergy to shrimp.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired nurse [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Hospital6 1130**].  Tobacco:  History of one pack per day for 20 to 30
years, quit 10 to 15 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with breast cancer, father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**]
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 97.6, heart
rate 100, blood pressure 149/70, respirations 22, oxygen
saturation 94% on 10 liters.  General:  Awake, alert,
dyspneic, mildly uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation, extraocular movements intact, mucous membranes
moist, oropharynx clear.  Heart:  Regular, normal S1, S2, no
murmurs.  Neck:  Bounding carotid pulse, no jugular venous
distention.  Lungs:  Bilateral coarse rhonchi and trace
expiratory wheezes, decreased breath sounds at left base.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.  Neurologic:  Strength 5/5
and equal bilaterally in upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 25.8, hematocrit
35.6, platelets 404.  INR 1.2.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.8,
chloride 97, bicarbonate 24, BUN 13, creatinine 0.7, glucose
127.  Magnesium 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on day number one of admission for
further management of her left main stem bronchial
obstruction.  A rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and
stent placement was performed without complications.  A CT of
the chest done prior to this procedure had confirmed the left
main stem occlusion extending into the right upper lobe
bronchus, and additionally showed a small left pleural
effusion, extensive right ground-glass opacities, septal
thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread.  The patient
was placed on levofloxacin and clindamycin given the
possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.

After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the
Medical service, where she continued to have a substantial
oxygen requirement at rest.  At baseline, she required 5 to 6
liters nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 89
to 90%.  She received periodic Atrovent and albuterol
nebulizer treatments, which increased her oxygen saturation
when she would desaturate to the mid-80s.  She also required
non-rebreather mask treatment on several occasions to
maintain her oxygen saturation.  It was felt that mucous
plugging was partially responsible for this, as her oxygen
saturations would improve after she coughed up mucous.  She
had two follow-up chest x-rays which were consistent with the
prior findings and revealed no interval development of heart
failure or pneumonia.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient was noted to be in paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation/flutter during the entire course of her
admission.  A Cardiology consult saw the patient when she was
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and recommended
initiation of amiodarone and discontinuation of flecainide.
She was rate controlled with metoprolol.

On the evening of transfer to the floor, which was [**2138-12-17**], the patient returned to atrial fibrillation/flutter
with a ventricular rate of 100 to 140 beats per minute.  Her
rate was brought down with both oral and intravenous
metoprolol.  The following day, the patient agreed to undergo
ablation of her right atrial flutter focus upon consultation
with the Electrophysiology service.  This procedure was
performed on [**12-19**] without incident.  The patient was
initially in sinus rhythm following the procedure, but had
two instances where she returned to what was felt to be a
left atrial flutter rhythm with ventricular rates between 80
and 100.

She is transferred to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with plans to
continue amiodarone 400 mg three times a day for seven
additional days, followed by 400 mg once daily for three
weeks, followed by 200 mg once daily.  She is to obtain [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor upon discharge.

The patient was anticoagulated with heparin throughout this
admission for atrial fibrillation/flutter.  She was placed on
Warfarin after the ablation procedure.  She is to be
overlapped with heparin until her INR becomes therapeutic.

3.  Oncology:  The patient had been seen by a medical
oncologist and a radiation oncologist at [**Hospital1 1562**] prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].  She
expressed the wish that she be treated at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
by these physicians, so management of her lung cancer was
deferred.  The pathology from her bronchoscopy returned
consistent with poorly-differentiated large-cell carcinoma.
She is being transferred to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for resumption
of this care.

4.  Infectious Disease:  As above, the patient was initiated
on a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for
post-obstructive pneumonia.  Upon transfer, the patient has
five days remaining to complete this course.  The culture
from her bronchial washings grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.
On discharge, her white blood count was down-trending from
19.0 on the 21st to 17.3 on the 22nd, to 15.4 on the 23rd.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had problems with both
constipation and nausea this admission.  Her constipation was
resolved with a light bowel regimen.  Her nausea was improved
with scheduled Compazine and as needed Zofran.  Liver
function tests drawn the day prior to discharge are pending
at the time of this dictation.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on her admission
dose of levothyroxine.  A TSH drawn this admission was
normal.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Large-cell lung cancer, status post
left bronchial stent, atrial fibrillation/flutter, status
post ablation, pneumonia, hypothyroidism

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair to poor

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth three times
a day, Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once daily, heparin per
protocol, amiodarone 400 mg by mouth three times a day,
ipratropium two puffs inhaled four times a day, albuterol two
puffs inhaled every six hours as needed, fluticasone 440 mcg
inhaled twice a day, salmeterol two puffs inhaled twice a
day, clindamycin 300 mg by mouth every six hours for five
days, levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 24 hours for five
days, levothyroxine 75 mcg by mouth once daily, brimonidine
ophthalmic solution, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily,
Compazine 10 mg by mouth every six hours, Zofran 4 mg
intravenously every six hours as needed

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment
of her lung cancer.


ADDENDUM
Patient was set to leave for [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, howver it was
noted on day of discharge she was noted to be veyr short of
breath and CXR revealed lobasr collapse c/w stent obstruction.
She was taken to the operating room for repeat rigid bronch that
revealed repeat occlusion with tumor. This was treated with laser
treatment but pt continued to have respiratory difficulty. She
elected to make herself comfort measures only.  She was started
on a morphine drip to treat her respiratory distress and
eventually passed away in her room at the [**Hospital1 18**].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old woman
who was transferred from the MICU after a rigid bronchoscopy
and stent placement in her left main stem bronchus on
[**2138-12-16**] for a near total occlusion due to
adenocarcinoma.  The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation since [**2136-11-30**].  She first
noticed dyspnea when walking in the spring of [**2137**], more
rapidly progressive since [**2138-5-31**].

Over the past several weeks, she has had multiple admissions
to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for recurrent atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response; she was started on digoxin,
Diltiazem, and flecainide.  During her latest admission at
[**Last Name (LF) 1562**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abnormal V/Q scan prompted a CT scan, which
revealed a soft tissue mass compressing the left main stem
bronchus.  She received bronchoscopy on [**2138-12-13**]
which revealed the mass occluding 90% of the bronchus.
Cytology was consistent with adenocarcinoma.

The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for rigid
bronchoscopy and stent placement.

On the night of admission, the patient had an increased
oxygen requirement, requiring a nonrebreather.  Chest x-ray
and CT were concerning for postobstructive pneumonia, right
upper lobe bronchus occlusion, lymphangitic spread of the
cancer.  She was transferred to the MICU on [**2138-12-15**].  A Cardiology consult recommended Amiodarone and
long-term warfarin for the atrial fibrillation with
discontinuation of the flecainide.  The patient was started
on clindamycin and levofloxacin for possible postobstructive
pneumonia.  A bronchoscopy with stent placement was performed
on [**2138-12-16**] without complications.

The patient noted increased easier breathing since, without
pain.  She continues to be in and out of atrial
fibrillation/flutter.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Nonsmall cell cancer, see above.
3.  History of positive PPD with negative AFB on
bronchoscopy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to shrimp.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Thirty pack year history of smoking, quit 15
years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with breast cancer, father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**]
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
maximum 97.9, heart rate 73, blood pressure 112/50,
respirations 23, oxygen saturation 89% on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  HEENT: The pupils were 3 mm to light, reactive.
Sclerae anicteric.  The oral mucosa was moist.  No lesions.
Neck:  Without cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Lungs:  Crackles one-half the way up bilaterally in the right
lung field, left lung clear to auscultation.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, with decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Trace pretibial edema.  Neurologic:  Alert,
mentating well, no gross focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 17.3, hematocrit 34.8,
platelets 459,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.3, chloride 98,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 19, creatinine 0.7, glucose 103, calcium
8.5, phosphate 3.9, magnesium 2.0.

Bronchial washings:  1+ PMNs, 1+ gram-positive cocci in
pairs.

X-ray post stent revealed significant re-expansion of the
left lung, resolution of consolidation and infiltrates in the
left lower lobe, lingula with patchy infiltrates in the right
lung.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the MICU
and continued on her medications for pneumonia and atrial
fibrillation.  On [**2138-12-19**], the patient underwent an
atrial flutter ablation procedure.  Telemetry monitoring
after this procedure revealed intermittent periods of sinus
rhythm with atrial fibrillation.

On [**2138-12-21**], the patient dropped her oxygen
saturation to 83 to 85% on 6 liters nasal cannula and was
placed on a nonrebreather mask.  On further consultation with
the Electrophysiology Service, they recommended continuing
her Amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg t.i.d.

The patient and her husband expressed a desire to be
transferred back to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment
for her lung cancer.  However, the patient was not felt to be
a good candidate for transfer due to her persistent
hypoxemia.

On [**2138-12-23**], the patient underwent a repeat
bronchoscopy which revealed tumor tissue in the left main
stem bronchus just proximal to the proximal end of the stent.
She underwent debulking of the tumor and replacement of the
stent in a prolonged and difficult procedure.

On the morning of [**2138-12-24**], the patient developed
acute respiratory decompensation with a PA02 of 43 on a face
mask.  She reverted to atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response.  Throughout this time, the patient was
conscious and mentating well and she reiterated her desire
not to be intubated or to receive positive pressure
ventilation.  She understood that she would most likely go
into respiratory fatigue and failure in her current status
without these interventions.

The patient was subsequently placed on a morphine drip for
comfort.  The Palliative Care Service was consulted and per
their recommendations, nonessential medications were
discontinued, Amiodarone was continued for increasing the
chance of sinus rhythm to maximize comfort, and a scopolamine
patch was started in addition to the morphine drip.

The patient died on the morning of [**2138-12-28**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5266**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with mechanical ventilation
Left Subclavian central Line

History of Present Illness:
72 yo woman with lung CA, COPD, CAD who presented to [**Hospital1 2025**] ED with
worsening SOB. Patient initially diagnosed with squamous cell
lung CA in [**4-18**] with RUL mass. S/p XRT and chemo with
Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **] with substantial improvement in RUL mass therefore
patient underwent RUL lobectomy with improvement of symptoms.
Patient then returned to clinic with increased SOB in [**5-18**] and
found to have extensive mediastinal tumor encasing her trachea
and with narrowing of her esophagus. She had a tracheal stent
placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2143-5-16**]. Bronchial washings showed
recurrence of squamous cell Ca and the patient was started on
low dose Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **]. Patient found to have progression of
disease afer this therapy and was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] on
[**2144-5-21**] who felt that the patient would not tolerate further
chemotherapy. No further oncologic treatment has been offered.
.
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 2025**] ED c/o sudden onset of SOB. Recently
had low grade fevers at home and mildly increased SOB from
baseline over past 3-4 days. On presentation patient was ""dusky""
and NRB was placed with O2 sats 100%.  Patient also had
increased work of breathing and attempt was made to intubate x 2
in the ED. This was unsuccessful due to stenosis of the trachea
and therefore the patietn was taken to the OR for intubation.
CXR showed RUL consolidation felt to be a pneumonia and
therefore patietn received Azithromycin, Vanco and Gent. EKG
showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in lead III in one QRS complex with TWI
in V1-V2. Patient was bolused with Heparin and started on drip.
Otherwise VSS per report and patient transfered for further care
at request of daughter. [**Name (NI) **] spoke with PCP who then spoke with
daughter and decided no cardiac cath, but wanted medical
management with hope to wean from vent quickly.

Past Medical History:
-lung cancer in right upper lobe, ~4 years ago, treated with
chemotherapy and surgery
-neuropathy around lung cancer surgery scar
-diabetes, diagnosed in '[**29**], followed at [**Hospital **] Clinic

-osteoarthritis of knees, hips
-polymyalgia rheumatica, 8-9 years
-macular degeneration, recently diagnosed
-s/p right cataract surgery
-hypertension, controlled with medication
- Mult ED admissions for hypoglycemia.


Social History:

Physical Exam:
VS: 95.6 (ax) 91/54  20  94% (AC 400/18 Peep 5 FiO2 100)
Gen: Intubated and sedated, minimally responsive on no sedation.

HEENT: PERRL, no scleral injection or icterus, elevated JVP to
mandible, neck supple
CVS: Distan HS, regular, unable to appreciate any murmurs but
exam imited by BS
Chest: coarse bronchial BS throughout, NO R anterior BS, lat
[**Last Name (un) 8434**] with mild wheeze
ABd: mild distention, NABS, soft, no masses
Ext: cool to touch, no mottling, pulses + by doppler
Neuro: arousable to voice, following commands

Pertinent Results:
CT Chest [**2144-6-23**]: Impression:
1. Interval increase in the mediastinal soft tissue extending up
to the hilum
and causing narrowing of the right and left main bronchi. There
is slight
improvement in the narrowing of the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe
bronchi.
2. Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, very
minimal on the
right and moderate on the left.
3. New right lower lobe pneumonia, likely to aspiration.
4. Stable left upper lobe spiculated nodular lesion.
5. Stable post-radiation changes in the right lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 yo woman with NSCLC s/p chemo, s/p R upper lobectomy
with recurrence of mass surrounding trachea s/p tracheal stent.
Patient admitted with respiratory failure [**12-18**] COPD exacerbation/
progressive [**Hospital 4699**] transferred to MICU from OSH hypotensive and
intubated.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and
progressive Lung CA now encasing her trachea. Most recent PFTs
indicate FEV1/FVC = 90 suggestive of concomitant restrictive
disease likely [**12-18**] to chest wall disease/infiltrative CA.
Patient with tracheal stent but now required intubation after
becoming cyanotic with increased work of breathing. Also CXR at
OSH showed R sided infiltrate, ?PNA vs. infiltrative CA vs. post
obstructive. Pt has elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of
infectious process. Sputum positive for coag + staph aureus,
likely MRSA. Patient still on AC but weaned O2 down to 40%.
Sedation was weaned with patient tolerating ET tube without
difficulty. However, careful ET tube care required since patient
very difficulty to intubate given tracheal constriction -
required surgical placement at OSH. Bronchoscopy performed in
the MICU showed obstruction of the L main stem bronchus which is
odd considering the patient's CA is on the right.
Atrovent/Albuterol MID continued via ET tube q 6 hrs.
Solu-Medrol for COPD exacerbation for 72 hrs. Patient was
treated with Levaquin initially, now only Vancomycin since
sputum growing gram positive cocci, coag positive, likely MRSA
given patient's history. Vancomycin dosed at 750 mg IV daily. CT
of the chest was performed to evaluate for interval change
regarding her lung CA and new infiltrate on CXR. This showed
interval increase in the mediastinal soft tissue extending up to
the hilum and causing narrowing of the right and left main
bronchi, slight
improvement in the narrowing of the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe
bronchi. Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions,
very minimal on the
right and moderate on the left. New right lower lobe pneumonia,
likely to aspiration. Stable left upper lobe spiculated nodular
lesion. Stable post-radiation changes in the right lung. Sputum
cultures also came back positive for MRSA and sparse GNR growth.
Patient was continued on Vancomycin with goal trough >15,
measured at 16. On [**2144-7-27**] patient went to the OR on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for removal of her tracheal stents with placement of a
Y-shaped stent covering both her left and right main stem
bronchi. This was performed successfully and patient was noted
to be easily intubated. Patient returned to the ICU and
continued on mechanical ventilation. She underwent several
spontaneous breathing trials on pressure support of [**3-19**] without
any difficulty. The decision to extubate her was pending
discussing with the patient and her daughter regarding her
re-intubation should she fail extubation. The final decision was
that the patient wished to be DNR/DNI and did not want a
tracheostomy. The patient's status was optimized for extubation.
She was diuresed to 1.8 L and weaned off sedation with a good
cough reflex. She was successfully extubated on [**2144-7-30**]. She
continued to saturate well with shuvel mask and then NC and then
on room air. She was diuresed further post extubation and then
started on her home regimen of 20 mg Lasix daily.
.
# CAD: Patient with 1 mm elevation in III, TWI in V1-V2 new
compared to EKG [**4-7**] and q waves in anteroseptal leads likely
representing an old anteroseptal MI but does not meet criteria
for acute STEMI. Cardiac enzymes negative x 3. Patient arrived
on heparin gtt later discontinued given lack of evidence for
acute MI. Patient hypotensive with BP 70s/40s requiring dopamine
with improvement in SBP to 100-120/50-60. s/p L subclavian line
placement upon arrival. Patient weaned off dopamine after first
day of admission with maintenance of BP with IVF. Goals to
maintain CVP >8, MAP >65. IVF NS bolus were given liberally to
maintain BP. Patient also restarted on Lisinopril once her BP
was stable. Beta blockers were held due to her severe COPD.  ASA
and Lipitor were continued.
.
# DM: Patient with history of hypoglycemic episodes in past.
Patient was monitored closely on insulin gtt with excellent
sugar control, requiring increased doses after initiation of
steroids. After extubation, patient was transferred to RISS with
advancing diet with good control.
.
# PPx - Heparin SC, pneumaboots, PPI, FS with Insulin gtt, OG
feeds then PO intake after extubation.
.
# FEN - OG feeds running as per nutrition recs, diet later
advanced slowly after extubation, bolus IVF as needed, monitor
electrolytes with repletion.
.
# Comm - Daughter.
.
# Code: Confirmed DNR/DNI during this admission after lengthy
conversations with both patient and daughter.
-------------
After her ICU course, she was transferred to the floor and plans
were made to transition her to hospice care. On the floor, her
care was geared towards comfort measures. Her code status was
discussed with her daughter. The pain and palliative care who
agreed with morphine for pain control/resp distress. She was
discharged to hospice.

CXR [**3-19**]: The radiograph is markedly suboptimal in technique and
motion of the patient.
The heart is enlarged. There is consolidation of the left lower
lobe with mass in the left hilar area. There is probably a small
bilateral pleural effusion.
The patient has prior CABG and median sternotomy. Combined AICD
and pacemaker leads probably terminate in the right atrium and
right ventricle, which is obscured by the motion.

CXR [**3-20**]: Limited chest x-ray demonstrating cardiac enlargement
and findings suggestive of congestive heart failure. It is
difficult to fully exclude underlying pneumonia.
In this patient with history of lung mass, there is a
questionable opacity at the right apex for which standard PA and
lateral chest radiographs are suggested as well as comparison to
the patient's outside films.

CXR [**3-21**]: Interval placement of right IJ central venous catheter
in satisfactory position with no pneumothorax seen on this
supine radiograph. Persistent CHF and left lower lobe
consolidation/collapse.

ECG: Sinus rhythm, Right bundle branch block, Prior
inferolateral myocardial infarct

3. Tumor excision, left lower lobe.
4. Tumor destruction and Argon plasma coagulation.

ASSISTANT:  [**Name6 (MD) 19185**] [**Name8 (MD) 19186**], MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left mainstem tumor.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Tumor eminating from the basilar left
lower lobe.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Informed consent was obtained from
the patient. Indications and possible complications to the
procedure were explained to the patient, after which he was
brought to the operative theater number 12. General
anesthesia was instituted.  Once an adequate level of
anesthesia was reached, the patient was intubated easily with
a bronchoscope 12-13mm and thorough examination of the
tracheobronchial tree was done flexibly.

FINDINGS:
The vocal cords were normal in structure. The trachea was
patent.
The carina was splayed, suggestive subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
The right mainstem, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius and
lower lobes are patent. The left main stem proximally is patent,
but there was 85% distal obstruction from a tumor eminating from
the lower lobe.  The lower lobe was completely obstructed, and
the left upper lobe is patent.

The rigid scope was advanced into the left mainstem and under
direct vision, using the rigid forceps, biopsy and tumor
excision
was done. At that moment, the left lower lobe was opened and
there was evidence of tumor emanating mostly from the
basilar segments. Tumor destruction was also done with Argon
plasma coagulation and hemostasis was accomplished.  The
superior segment of the left lower lobe was patent.

BLOOD LOSS:  Approximately 150 ml.

The patient was extubated and he was transferred to the
Medical ICU. Note that a frozen section pathology was done on
the
slides which showed necrotic tissue,  highly suggestive of
carcinoma. Final pathology is pending.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: The pt was felt to be hypoxic secondary to a
post-obstructive pneumonia (LLL consolidation on CXR),
superimposed on lungs damaged by COPD.  He did not appear to be
in CHF and actually appeared volume depleted on exam.  He was
weaned from a non-rebreather to a 40% face tent.  His baseline
O2 sat is probably in the high 80s-low 90s, and so his oxygen
was titrated to that.  He underwent a bronchoscopy which
revealed a LLL tumor completely obstructing his bronchus.  They
excised the tumor and destroyed it with APC, wiht resultant
patent airways (did not require a stent.)  After the procedure
he was extubated in the OR without complication.  He
intermittently became hypoxic to the 70s-low 80s, which was felt
to be due to his pneumonia and COPD.  He was treated with
levofloxacin and metronidazole for his post-obstructive
pneumonia, for a total 14 day course (last day will be [**2112-4-1**].)
 He was continued on atrovent and albuterol nebulizers as well
as a salmeterol inhaler. He has been stable on 6 L NC and
occasoianally deasturates and needs a NRB facemask.

2. Hypotension:  He became hypotensive and febrile a day after
admission, and was transferred to the MICU.  He was fluid
resuscitated, vancomycin was added to the levofloxacin and
metronidazole, and begun on dopamine.   He was weaned off the
dopamine on [**3-22**].  His [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim test was appropriate (19-->41).
His blood cultures were negative to date, and a urine culture
was negative.  By the day of transfer back to the VA, he was
actually hypertensive in the 140s-150s, and was restarted on his
home regimen of Atenolol.  He was not given an ACE due to his
renal failure.  He continued to require IV fluid boluses for a
low CVP (1-5 range).

3. Hx of ischemic cardiomyopathy:  His ACE was held due to renal
failure.  He was restarted on his atenolol once his bp
stabilized.  He was continued on his atorvastatin.  He had no
signs of failure on his exam here, although one night his sats
acute dropped to the low 80s and he was given Lasix.  He put out
3 liters, and the next morning appeared volume depleted (with Na
155), and so he likely is not in failure.

4. bladder cancer: the foley was kept in throughout his
admission.

5. Acute on chronic renal failure:  His baseline is 2.1-2.6, but
peaked at 3.3.  He was down to 2.8 by discharge.  This was felt
to be due to prerenal physiology.

6. Anemia:  He was anemic in the low 30s throughout his stay,
and dropped to a low of 28.  Given his CAD, he was transfused
one unit, but responded only to 29.  The next day, he had an
episode of melena/dark red blood per rectum.  His hematocrit was
checked and was stable.  He needs a GI workup once he is back at
the VA.  He remained hemodynamically stable throughout.

7. Endocrine: He was kept on an insulin sliding scale.

8. Electrolytes:  He developed hypernatremia to 155 after he was
given Lasix and put out 3 liters in a day.  This resolved with
free water boluses.

9. Mental status:  This appeared to wax and wane.  He would
intermittently become confused (knew he was in a hospital,
didn't know the city).  It was likely due to ICU delirium vs.
hypernatremia.  On discharge, he was still delerious.

10. Nutrition: The patient needs to be on a pureed diet. He
mainly ate isce cream during this admission. He needs a
nutrition consult once transferred and may need a PEG at some
point depending on his goals of care.

11. Code status: This was discussed repeatedly on this
admission. The patient was never very articulate about his goals
of care. He understands that her has a terminal illness and at
times said he did not want to be intubated or rescusiated.
However, he then said he wanted to ""go for broke."" Therefore he
was full code here, but this needs and a health care proxy needs
to be addressed by his oncologist or PCP.

History of Present Illness:
69yo woman originally admitted to [**Hospital **] Hosp with N/V back
pain.  She had a panendoscopy which revealed gastritis and
inflammatory bowel disease. Patient was placed on Asacol but
symptoms persisted.
.
She underwent an MRI for further workup which showed disc
herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm subcarinal mass.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy, found L mainstem obstruction,
tried to bx but c/b bleeding, needed intubation for airway
protection.
.
Transferred to BIMDC to IP service.  A rigid bronchoscopy was
performed and a stent was placed in the left main stem with
improved aeration of the left lower lobe. Preliminary pathology
was consistent with non-small cell lung cancer. Patient reported
decreased appetite, nausea and weight loss of 40 pounds. She was
already seen by Heme/Onc in the trauma SICU.
.
She was extubated on [**5-28**] in the am.  In the trauma SICU, it was
felt that she had a LLL PNA and was started on levofloxacin.
She was also found to be hypertensive after extubation and
received on IV hydralazine. Her BP remained well controlled
after that. She was still somnolent in the afternoon after the
procedure. She last received 1mg of Ativan at 8am. Her VS were
stable upon transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o F found to have large lung mass at [**Hospital **] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further car, now s/p rigid bronchoscopy with stenting
of left main bronchus and biopsy confirming NSCLC.
.
1. NSCLC/Lung Mass - Patient was monitored briefly in the trauma
ICU after the procedure. Pathology was consistent with NSCLC.
LDH and LFTs were wnl. Transient blood-streaked sputum after
bronchoscopy resolved towards the day of discharge. Megace was
continued for poor appetite. Metastatic workup (i.e MRI of the
brain, CT abdomen/pelvis and bone scan) were negative. Patient
is going to follow up with oncology as an outpatient. Likely
requiring consultation with radiation oncology for concurrent
chemotherapy/XRT, followed by consolidation chemotherapy (if
patient is able to tolerate). Patient should continue mucinex
until seen as outpatient by IP in 5 wks from now.
.
2. Pneumonia/Leukocytosis - Patient developed leukocytosis in
the trauma SICU but was also briefly on stress-dose steroids
(for possible cuff leak). Patient also had intermittent cough
with sputum production. Interventional pulmonology team felt her
clinical picture was consistent with PNA. Patient was started on
levofloxacin which was continued empirically when transferred to
the medicine floor. Sputum culture revealed no growth. Patient
completed 7 day course. Leukocytosis was trending down towards
discharge. Patient continued to have a cough but remained
afebrile and clinically stable.
.
3. HTN - Patient was hypertensive post-procedure requiring IV
hydral. Patient was restarted on her BB and HCTZ. Patient
remained intermittently hypertensive even after transfer to
medicine floor. Patient was started on an ACEI with increaesing
doses throughout her hospital stay. Her BB was also uptitrated.
She still required Hydral PO as needed for hypertensive episodes
but her BP became better controlled towards the end of her
hospital stay. She was discharged on an optimized regimen of BB,
HCTZ and lisinopril. She should follow up with her PCP who
should adjust these medications as needed.
.
4. Murmur - systolic murmur at USB with radiation to both
carotids. Not previously noted on OSH records. DDx included AS,
HOCM, flow murmur, ? related to bronchial stent. Murmur
disappeared after two days indicating that it was most likely
related to flow or transient tissue swelling from the
bronchoscopy and stent placement. Her PCP should monitor for
recurrence of this murmur and obtain an echo if needed.
.
5. AFib - paroxysmal per OSH records. Patient remained in SR
during this hospitalization. She was on no anticoagulation on
admission and was kept off any anticoagulation given malignancy
workup including uncertainty about brain metastases (prior to
acquisition of brain MRI). Patient should follow up with her
PCP.
.
6. IBD - recently diagnosed at OSH. Patient was continued on
Asacol.
.
7. Gastritis - Mild chronic gastritis diagnosed at OSH on EGD.
H. pylori negative per OSH records. Continued PPI and Reglan.
.
8. Chronic back pain - Patient underwent MRI study at OSH which
showed disc herniation, T8-T10, and incidentally also a 6cm
subcarinal mass for which she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Metastatic
workup did not reveal any bone lesions (see above). Patient was
given Oxycodone as needed for back pain.
.
9. Psych - Continued Zoloft and Alprazolam.
.
10. F/E/N: IVF. Repleted lytes PRN. Cardiac diet.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and left lung mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old female
ex-smoker with COPD referred from an outside hospital for
further workup of left lung mass, which was noted during the
workup of increased shortness of breath, night sweats, and
fever in early [**Month (only) 956**].  The patient underwent a PET scan
and bronchoscopy with biopsy at an outside hospital.  Both
these studies were reported negative by the patient.

On presentation in the clinic on the day of admission, the
patient complained of approximately one month of chest pain
and heaviness extending to the left shoulder and neck.  The
patient on further questioning reported having episodes of
chest pain about once or twice a week over the past two

to two packs per day for 18 years, but had quit in [**2129**].  The
patient continued to drink once to twice a week.  The patient
lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Lung cancer in multiple relatives.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On presentation, the patient's vital signs
were 97.9, 84, 107/51, 20, and 96% on 3 liters by nasal
cannula.  Physical exam was notable for irregular heart rate
and clear lungs with an expiratory wheeze.  Patient had an
obese soft abdomen with a well-healed midline incision as
well as a paramedian scar with a possibility of a
supraumbilical incisional hernia.  Patient had 1+ bilateral
lower extremity edema.

LABORATORIES:  On admission, the patient's white count was
7.8, hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 313.  Coagulation
studies were normal.  Chemistries were also normal with a
creatinine of 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival in her hospital room, the
patient was evaluated by Surgery house officer.  An immediate
EKG was obtained, which revealed no evidence of ischemia.
Patient was given some sublingual nitroglycerin, which
appeared to relieve some of her shortness of breath.  Cardiac
enzymes were drawn with three sets sent.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative.  Consultations were requested from the
Pulmonary service as well as the Cardiology service.

As part of the workup of the patient's lung mass, the patient
underwent a CAT scan of her chest, which confirmed the
finding of a left upper lobe lung mass.  Patient was noted to
have some hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  A CAT scan
of the patient's head revealed no evidence of metastases.
Bronchoscopy of the patient performed by the Pulmonary
service on the day following admission revealed
tracheobronchomalacia with an endobronchial tumor noted in
the distal left main stem bronchus.  No biopsy was attempted.

Patient was seen by the Cardiology service.  Echocardiogram
was obtained, which was essentially normal.  The patient's
chest pain was ultimately deemed noncardiac in origin and no
further workup was recommended.

Patient was taken to the OR on [**2139-5-8**] with intention to
perform a mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, and possible
Chamberlain procedure.  Patient underwent the bronchoscopy
and mediastinoscopy.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.
The patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
while intubated with intention on extubating her the
following day.  The patient was confirmed to have via
tracheobronchomalacia during an intraoperative bronchoscopy.

The patient was extubated as planned on postoperative day #1.
Her oxygen saturations remained in the 93-96% range on 3
liters by nasal cannula.

By postoperative day #2, the patient was doing very well.
Her pain was well controlled.  Her oxygen saturations were
stable on 3 liters by nasal cannula.  Discharge planning was
initiated, and the patient was ultimately discharged on
postoperative day #3.

The patient had been seen on hospital day #2 by the Podiatry
service for examination of her feet and nails.  Patient was
confirmed to have some onychomycosis, and was started on an
antifungal medication for this.

History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 83 year old female with small cell lung
cancer who was accepted in transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Patient is with known right small cell lung cancer undergoing
chemotherapy/radiation therapy at [**Hospital3 1563**] [**Hospital3 **]. She
now presents with acute respiratory falure and is status-post
intubation. The reports from the outside hospital indicate
extrinsic compression from right mainstem bronchus obstructing
the proximal airway now with complete collapse of the right
hemithorax with partial collapse of the left hemithroax. CT
scans from [**Hospital1 1562**] indicate a large volume tumor encasing the
right lung. The patient's family was advised of her dismal
prognosis, and the patient was admitted for the possibility of a
meaningful intervention with the goal of palliative therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a
bronchoscopy on [**2163-11-11**]. This revealed a completely obstructed
right upper lobe with tumor and submucosal infiltration of the
proximal right mainstem bronchus. Post-bronchoscopy, a chest
xray showed partial re-expansion of the right lower lobe. The
patient was placed on a CPAP trial the next morning, which she
passed. She was extubated for a period of a few hours. However,
due to increasing respiratory effort, the patient soon fatigued,
and required emergent re-intubation. The patient was fully
conscious at this time, and willingly indicated a desire to be
re-intubated. A repeat chest xray showed a re-accumulation of
fluid in the right hemithorax with collase of the right lower
lobe. The patient was kept intubated and on supportive care
until [**2163-11-15**], when the patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy
and placement of a PleurX catheter on the right. This was done
in the hopes that the patient could be extubated once the
pleural effusion was cleared. However, the patient failed to
properly wean off the vent. Following on-going dialogue with the
patient's family, it was decided that the patient would be made
comfort measures only on [**2163-11-20**]. The patient was extubated and
expired several hours later.

16818,170771,LUNG CANCER;RESPIRATORY FAILURE,"Admission Date:  [**2115-7-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-7-18**]

Date of Birth:   [**2056-9-7**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL MICU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Dyspnea and left lung collapse.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman
with a 90 pack year smoking history who had worsening dyspnea
and cough for several months which worsened in the three days
prior to admission at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2115-7-9**].  She
had chest x-ray in [**2114-11-6**] showing no abnormalities
besides healing rib fractures.  She had endorsed losing 15
pounds over the six months prior to admission because of loss
of appetite.

On admission to [**Hospital1 1562**], the chest x-ray showed complete
opacification of the left lung.  She was taken to
bronchoscopy where a left main stem bronchus neoplasm was
found.  The patient did not tolerate the bronchoscopy well
and was coughing with 02 desaturations.  She was intubated
and underwent biopsies of the left main stem bronchus lesion.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a rigid bronchoscopy
with possible stent intervention by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcohol abuse.
2.  History of narcotic dependence.
3.  History of pneumonia.
4.  Adult ADHD.
5.  History of reactive airways disease/asthma.
6.  History of a left hip fracture in [**2114**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had ""[**Name2 (NI) **] cancer"" and MI.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ninety pack year smoking history, quit in
[**2114**].  History of alcohol abuse in the past but reportedly
sober for one year, according to the daughter of the patient.
The patient has also been requiring narcotics for her left
hip fracture since last year and had evidence of dependence.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER:
1.  Morphine drip.
2.  Versed drip.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Effexor.
2.  Prempro.
3.  Seroquel.
4.  Ativan.
5.  Ritalin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs:
Temperature 99.4, heart rate 106, BP 127/67.  Ventilator
settings at AC 400 by 12 at a PEEP of 5 and 100% FI02.
General:  She was a well appearing intubated woman in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae and dry
oropharynx.  There was some red bloody secretions in the
endotracheal tube.  Chest:  The chest revealed some very
decreased breath sounds at the left upper lobe.  The right
lung field was clear.  Cardiac:  The cardiac examination
revealed a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border radiating to the carotids.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, no distention.  Extremities:  No pedal edema.  She
had good dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologic:  The patient
moves all extremities and is intermittently agitated and will
try to sit up from the bed.  She does not respond to voice
nor follows commands but is currently sedated.

LABORATORY DATA UPON PRESENTATION:  White count 13.2,
hematocrit 32, platelets 626,000.  The Chem 7 is unremarkable
with a normal bicarbonate at 22.  CK at the outside hospital
was 130 with a negative troponin.  The ABG on this setting
was 7.31, PC02 49, P02 135 on 100% FI02.  Her coagulations
were normal.  Microbiology results at the outside hospital
showed MSSA from the sputum in the bronchoscopy as well as
[**Female First Name (un) 564**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  LEFT BRONCHIAL MASS:  The patient was
kept intubated for signs of hypoventilation upon arrival to
the [**Hospital1 18**] and MICU.  She was stable over the weekend and did
not experience significant [**Hospital1 **] loss from the biopsy at the
outside hospital.  She continued to have agitation while on
the ventilator but was easily sedated with Ativan, morphine,
and propofol drips.

She was taken for CT of the airway with reconstruction as
well as rigid bronchoscopy on [**2115-7-15**] where the left
main stem bronchus lesion showed a 70% luminal narrowing and
no distal airway patency.  A metal stent was placed with no
resulting inflation of the lung postprocedure.  She remained
intubated showing signs of hypoventilation.  She was also
treated for MSSA pneumonia with Oxacillin initially.  She
also was treated with vancomycin for a temperature while on
Oxacillin.  Additional Gram's stain revealed gram-negative
rods and she was started on ciprofloxacin and then switched
to levofloxacin for concern of gram-negative rod coverage.

The day postbronchoscopy, the family was informed of the
ineffectiveness of the stent regarding her ability to
ventilate that lung.  The patient's family was informed of
the poor prognosis regarding weaning off mechanical
ventilation.  She continued to spike low-grade fevers while
on the Oxacillin and Fluoroquinolone.

She was watched for one day post stent with no improvement in
chest x-ray appearance of the left lung collapse.  It was
determined at this time that the patient probably would not
improve on the ventilator and the patient's daughter agreed
to extubation and comfort measures only for the patient.

It should also be noted that a pleural effusion was noted on
the left lung and 800 cc were drained in the OR during rigid
bronchoscopy when a left chest tube was placed to that side.
Cytology is pending on that specimen but was thought to be
most likely a malignant pleural effusion.

The patient underwent extubation on [**2115-7-17**] and was
administered Ativan and morphine drips, titrating up for
sedation and comfort.  The patient expired early
approximately 5:30 a.m. on [**2115-7-18**].  The family was
notified and they declined a postmortem examination.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109238**] is a 86-year-old gentleman who had undergone a left
lower lobectomy for stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer many
years prior. On
surveillance CT scan he was noted to have an enlarging lesion in
the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. This was
concerning for a second primary lung cancer and he was brought
to the operating room today for resection. Given his
diminished pulmonary function, we determined that should this
prove to be a cancer we would not perform a lobectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 109238**] was admitted on [**2195-12-21**] for  Right video assisted
thoracoscopy, decortication of lung and wedge resection of right
upper lobe.  He was extubated in the PACU and required CPAP
overnight for decreased oxygen saturation.  His chest-tube was
placed to suction.  The chest tube site oozed heme and was
monitored closely. The hemtocrit remained stable at 36-38.  His
pain was manged with a Dilaudid PCA.  The foley remained in
place.  On POD1 the Geratric Service was consulted to assist
with his medical management. The chest-tube was placed to
water-seal and serial chest film showed a small stable
pneumothorax. He was continued on hydrocortisone which converted
to PO prednisone on POD2.  He transferred to the floor. His
foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.

He was noted to have moderate agitation / sundowning during the
nighttime, and frequent reorientation was required by the
nursing staff.

His chest tube had a stable leak and was continued to suction
until [**2195-12-23**] (POD 2) when it was placed to waterseal -- still
with a leak. His follow up chest x-ray was stable. His leak
substantially decreased on POD 3, and he underwent a clamping
trial on POD 3. His POD 4 AM CXR was stable with no increased
pneumothorax, his chest tube was then pulled and follow up CXR
was stable. He continued to have an oxygen requirement in the
hospital and was discharged on home oxygen therapy.

His pain was well controlled at discharge and his incision site
was clean/dry and intact and with resolving amounts of crepitus.

He started his home dose of coumadin on his final hospital day
and was discharged stable, on his home regimen with close
followup from his PCP.

DATE OF DECEASED:  [**2183-4-21**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
status post right nephrectomy in [**2157**] with known lung
metastases status post left lower lobe and right lower lobe
resection, right bronchial stent, XRT therapy, and
phototherapy on [**10/2182**] and [**12/2182**], history of CAD status
post MI in [**2174**] and [**2178**] with LAD stent, history of
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25
percent, diabetes mellitus with chronic renal insufficiency,
presented with increasing shortness of breath at outside
hospital, found to have whiteout of right lung and
obstructive right mainstem bronchial stent.  Transferred here
for possible intervention.  On [**2183-4-15**], the patient
underwent stent removal after the stent was noted to have
migrated distally, with some granulation tissue present.  In
the PACU, the patient was noted to have left upper extremity
and left lower extremity weakness.  Neurology was called and
MRI was limited by movement but per the neuro team showed
multiple bilaterally likely embolic CVAs.  On [**2183-4-16**], the
patient had generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  He was given
Ativan and Dilantin.  Had a recurrent generalized tonic-
clonic seizure in the afternoon and was loaded with
fosphenytoin again.  He was transferred to the Neurology ICU
and had one recurrent seizure on [**2183-4-17**] and since has
been seizure free.  He was transferred to the floor on
[**2183-4-18**].

EKG 106 beats per minute, normal sinus rhythm, normal axis
and intervals, left atrial enlargement, old inferior
myocardial infarction, and T-wave inversions in 1 and aVL.
EEG on [**2183-4-16**] showed left frontal swelling.  MRI on
[**2183-4-16**] was nondiagnostic with movement artifact but
likely shows bilateral multiple CVAs, likely embolic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory.  The patient with metastatic
renal cell carcinoma to the lung, status post right mainstem
bronchial stent, status post removal with post-obstruction
pneumonia.  Cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae and MRSA on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone.  Saturating 90s on 40 percent
face mask.  We will continue 40 percent face mask.  The
patient's code status was DNR/DNI and after discussion with
the family on prognosis, he was made CMO.

Cardiovascular.  CAD, status post MI and LAD stent.  CHF with
ejection fraction 25 percent, not complaining of any anginal
symptoms.  The patient was dry to euvolemic.  He was given
gentamicin and IV fluids 75 cc an hour.  History of aspirin
allergy.  He was continued on Lipitor and his ACE inhibitor
was held as the patient with single kidney.  Blood pressure
was well controlled.

Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine roughly baseline
secondary to diabetes and status post nephrectomy.  He was
continued on Epogen and was given gentle IV fluids as his
urine output was low.

Renal cell carcinoma with metastases.  After discussion with
the family on patient's poor prognosis, his treatment was
converted to all palliative treatment, and Palliative Care
consult was obtained.

Neurological.  Multiple embolic bilateral CVAs, source may be
cardiogenic, although not a candidate for anticoagulation and
history of aspirin allergy.  The patient was continued on
Dilantin with a level of about 20.  He was not a candidate
for barbiturate therapy.  He was DNR/DNI.

DISPOSITION:  The patient's therapy was converted to
palliative care and the patient's code status was converted
to comfort measures only.  On [**2183-4-21**] at 6:20 a.m., the
patient was pronounced deceased.  His family was alerted.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient deceased.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.) Pulmonary: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated.
He was electively intubated at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital prior to
bronchoscopy there and remained intubated in anticipation of
further possible intervention. After arrival, overnight he was
maintained on AC on the vent. He had a chest CT overnight which
showed
--Perihilar lung mass measuring 4.0 x 2.9 cm causing occlusion
of the lower lobe branches to the left main pulmonary artery,
narrowing of the left proximal mainstem bronchus, and post
obstructive consolidation.
--Diffuse interstitial consolidation in the right upper lobe and
dependent consolidation in the right lower lobe with appearance
most typical for aspiration pneumonia.
--Bilateral pleural effusions, large in the left and small to
moderate in the right.
--Diffuse metastasis to multiple ribs and the T1 vertebral body,
as well as to the left adrenal gland.
In the AM [**2121-11-18**] the patient had a bedside thoracentesis both
therapeutic and diagnostic analyzing his left pleural effusion.
The effusion was exudative based on the lab results (see above).
A bronchoscopy was performed and no endobronchial lesions were
seen. The bronchioles were patent and a stent was not placed.
The patient will be continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the
possibility of a post-obstructive pneumonia. The results of the
pleural fluid cytology are still pending at the time of transfer
back to [**Hospital 1281**] hospital so it is unclear as to whether the
effusion was malignant(associated with lung CA) or [**1-13**]
infection. The patient was extubated on [**2121-11-19**] in the morning
without complication. He was evalutated at the bedside by Dr.
[**Name (NI) **] and the interventional pulmonary team using
ultrasound which did not reveal any reaccumulation of pleural
fluid at the thoracentesis site.

2. CV: The patient has a history of HTN. At home he takes
atenolol, this was initially held on transfer because the
patient's BP was low. On the day of extubation, the patient's BP
had normalized and he had an episode of tachycardia and
persistent HTN s/p extubation. He was restarted on his atenolol
and was given 10 mg IV hydralazine and may continue this Q6H for
today during transfer. His BP regimen may need to be readressed
at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital

3. NSC-lung CA: The patient has significant pain related to his
mets. He was on IV morphine in the hospital. On transfer he was
written for PO morphine SR and IR.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: On transfer, the patient was on
solumedrol for presumed adrenal insufficiency. A cortisol level
was drawn here and the level was markedly high, indicating the
steroids can be tapered and removed. The patient should be
placed on PO prednisone at [**Hospital 1281**] hospital and an appropriate
taper started.

5. FEN: The patient was initially NPO for the procedure, but at
the time of discharge was restarted on a regular diet.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  65-year-old male with left upper
lobe lung cancer.  He developed hemoptysis, and chest x-ray
revealed a mass.  He underwent mediastinoscopy/Chamberlain
and negative nodes.  Follow-up CT [**12-1**] revealed 3 and 5 cm
left upper lobe masses.  Now presents for left upper
lobectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post catheterization on
[**2121-10-29**]; [**11-5**] echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of
greater than 55%; catheterization showed two vessel disease,
six stents to right coronary artery/mid-right coronary artery
dissection.  Myocardial infarction [**11-27**] with troponin-i at
12.3.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease status post aortobifemoral,

amputations; renal artery graft during aortobifemoral
3.  Type 2 diabetes
4.  Hypertension
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
6.  Hypercholesterolemia
7.  FEV-1 of 3.26, which is 96% of normal

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 31.3, INR 1.2, creatinine 1.
Liver function tests negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.7, pulse
69, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 150/60, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm, with
palpable femoral pulses bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2121-12-23**], at which time a left upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymphadenectomy was performed.  The patient
postoperative had complaints of vague chest pain, at which
time an electrocardiogram was checked and was found to be
normal, unchanged from baseline.

On early postoperative day one, the patient was found to have
decreased urine output, which did not respond to 250 cc
normal saline bolus.  The patient dropped his blood pressure,
at which time the epidural was stopped.  The patient
subsequently received one unit of blood for a hematocrit of
23, and a liter of crystalloid, and a dopamine infusion of 2
mcg/kg/minute was started.  An electrocardiogram at that time
revealed non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  Enzymes
were cycled, which showed an increase in the CK/MB as well as
the troponin-i.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where
he continued to do well enough so that the dobutamine drip
was weaned off.  The patient was transfused with another unit
of packed red blood cells.  A Cardiology consult was
obtained, which suggested Plavix for one year, as well as
agreeing with the current management.

The patient continued to do well in the Intensive Care Unit,
and was subsequently transferred in stable condition with a
stable blood pressure of 140, heart rate of 72, and oxygen
saturation of 92%, the patient was transferred to the
Surgical floor.

On the Surgical floor, intense pulmonary toilet was
continued, as well as good pain control.  On postoperative
day four, the patient continued to do well, and subsequently
the following day, the patient was discharged to home on
[**2121-12-28**].

Service:

In brief, the patient is a 73 year old male who was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] for evaluation of a right upper lobe mass.
Biopsies showed nonsquamous cell cancer.  He has had
pulmonary rehabilitation times two visits and had shortness
of breath.  The patient is also status post Levaquin for
productive sputum and he underwent a head CT at an outside
hospital which was reportedly negative for any metastatic
disease.  He now is admitted postoperatively after undergoing
right upper lobe wedge resection for non small cell lung
carcinoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, having home O2 requirement
times 2-3 years, status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2188**]
with residual mild left hemiparesis and a mild coronary
artery disease and hypertension.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Hydrochlorothiazide, Cozaar, Flovent,
albuterol nebulizers.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs with stable vital signs,
saturation 96% on nasal cannula oxygen.  He is awake, alert.
The heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were with
slightly coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender.  Extremities were warm.  No cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  The patient underwent right upper lobe wedge
resection on [**2195-7-29**].  He was extubated in the Operating
Room but required reintubation due to hypoxia and
hypoventilation.  The patient was then transferred to the
Post Anesthesia Care Unit, intubated in the Post Anesthesia
Care Unit.  He was extubated after which he again experienced
some respiratory distress.  This time the patient was treated
with biPAP.  Arterial blood gases at that time noted for PCO2
of 80 and low PO2 also.  The patient was then transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit with a biPAP mask and followed very
closely.  Over time, his arterial blood gases began to
improve until finally his PCO2 had normalized to his baseline
in the 60's and PO2 and oxygen saturation had also improved.
He was transferred out the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day one in stable condition.

Physical Therapy was also consulted and he was noted to be
ambulating extremely well.  On postoperative day number two,
the patient remained stable, remained afebrile.  He remained
in his baseline preoperative atrial fibrillation rhythm and
blood pressure was controlled.  His saturations were also
controlled with saturating 92% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
The patient underwent chest x-ray which looked stable.  Chest
tubes were removed and epidural and Foley catheter was also
removed.  The patient is currently doing extremely well and
will likely be discharged on postoperative day three, on
[**2195-8-1**] with home O2 and instructions to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Right upper lobe mass, status post
right upper lobe wedge resection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, mild coronary artery
disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Home medications plus Percocet [**12-9**]
p.o. q.6h. p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. q. day while taking
Percocet and home O2.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should continue with his
home O2 as previously prescribed.  The patient should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in approximately one week, next
Thursday.

Date of Birth:   [**2117-8-12**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU EAST

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year-old woman with
a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastases to
bone, axilla, thyroid with a history of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma in [**2144**] and recent right bronchial stent with
Photofrin injection in [**4-/2182**] and a right subclavian deep
venous thrombosis previously on Lovenox and Coumadin who
presented for a bronchoscopy and stent placement.  The
patient had recent admission on [**4-/2182**] when a right bronchial
stent was placed.  A tracheal stent was removed and replaced
and the patient received Photofrin therapy.  Since that time
the patient has been progressively more short of breath with
increased dyspnea on exertion from room to room.  The patient
denied palpitations.  She denied fever, chills, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  The patient reports resolved
hemoptysis and now persistent nonproductive cough.  The
patient also reports two weeks of occasional dull cranial
occipital pain.

The patient was CT angio on [**2182-5-10**], which did not reveal a
pulmonary embolus, but did show tumor progression with
compression of trachea and bronchi and a right subclavian
deep venous thrombosis.  The patient was started at that time
on Lovenox and Coumadin, which was discontinued on [**5-12**] in
preparation for her procedure.  In addition, the patient
denies numbness, weakness, and tingling.  She denies any
hearing changes, dysphagia, bowel and bladder incontinence or
back pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Non small cell lung cancer
diagnosed in [**2178**], status post right lobectomy in [**2178**] with
metastases in [**2182**] in right axilla, thyroid and bone.  She is
status post radiation therapy, status post carboplatin times
six cycles, last cycle on [**1-5**].  Status post Photofrin
injection and stent placement in [**4-6**].  2.  Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma in [**2144**] status post radiation therapy.  3.  Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy in [**2165**].  4.  Basal cell CA
unknown source.  5.  Ventricular irritability including
premature ventricular contractions.  7.  Right and left
subclavian deep venous thrombosis.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, which causes constipation.  Zofran
causes syncope.  Anesthetic tape causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Serevent one puff b.i.d.,
Albuterol two puffs q 4 to 6 hours prn, Lovenox and Coumadin,
which were discontinued on [**5-12**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married one son.  She is a
retired nurse.  She denies any alcohol, tobacco or drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown as she was adopted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination revealed a
temperature of 97.9.  Blood pressure 138/80.  Heart rate 96.
Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygenation revealed 94% on room air.
She was 130 pounds.  In general, she is a lively pleasant
woman, comfortable, but with audible breathing.  HEENT
examination normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes are
moist.  No occipital masses or tenderness.  Neck revealed no
JVD or lymphadenopathy, but a subclavian paratracheal mass.
Lungs were coarse bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on
the right with occasional rhonchi.  Her heart was
tachycardic, but regular.  Normal S1 and S2 with a 3 out of 6
systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds
were presents.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  She did have right upper extremity edema with trace
pitting.  Her neurological examination was alert and
oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  Her
motor strength was 5 out of 5 and symmetrical with normal
sensation, 1+ patella deep tendon reflexes bilaterally,
otherwise no deep tendon reflexes.  Babinski was unable to
quantified and she had no spinal tenderness.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 7.1
with 71 segments, 17 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes and 5
eosinophils.  Hematocrit 38, platelet 251.  PT 16.3, INR 1.8,
sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarb 23, BUN 10,
creatinine .5, glucose 88, albumin 3.5, calcium 9.2,
magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.8.  CT angiogram on [**5-10**] revealed
no PE, but did reveal extensive mediastinal disease with
distortion and compression and invasion of the airway with
interval increase since [**4-6**].  Mass source marked worsening
at the carina and main stem bronchi, right subclavian and
bronchocephalic vein.  Small pulmonary nodules likely
lymphangitic and hematogenous metastases as well as a right
chest wall mass and right breast lesion with skeletal
metastases.

IMPRESSION:  This was a 64 year-old woman with nonsmall cell
lung cancer and right subclavian deep venous thrombosis here
for stent placement secondary to disease progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary, nonsmall cell lung cancer
with increased mediastinal burden, increased shortness of
breath and dyspnea on exertion with recent right bronchial
stent placement.  No evidence of PE by CT angio.  The patient
was brought to interventional pulmonary Operating Room on
[**5-15**] where a bronchoscopy revealed significant obstruction to
the trachea at main stem as well as in the left main
bronchus.  The patient had a stent placed in the trachea as
well as in the left main bronchus and the right upper lobe
revealed obstruction in the posterior apical and anterior
segments.  The patient was extubated and was reintubated for
hypoxia and tachypnea and attempt at second extubation was
done, however, the patient was unable to remain extubated and
was reintubated for hypoxia and tachypnea.  The patient was
transferred back to the MICU at this time.  A repeat flexible
bronchoscopy was performed in the PACU with concerns for left
upper lobe collapse with question of upper lobe obstruction
from stent, but this was not clearly visualized.  Therefore
the patient remained intubated with etiology as probably
worsening of large airway obstruction.  The patient was
continued on ventilatory support and was followed by arterial
blood gas and ventilatory parameters.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for palliative
radiation therapy to her mediastinal mass for which she
received on [**5-17**].  The patient, however, continued to have
worsening oxygen requirements as well as had respiratory
acidosis and at this time the patient and her family
discussed with the attending changing her aim of care toward
comfort measures only.  The patient's family decided they did
not want anymore aggressive interventions.  The patient was
started on a morphine drip.  Her oxygen level was brought to
room air and ventilatory support was continued.  At 6:24 p.m.
I was called to see the patient after telemetry noted
asystole and no blood pressure.  The patient's examination
revealed bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, no heart or lung
sounds were heard and she had no response to painful stimuli.
The patient was pronounced dead at 6:24 p.m. on [**2182-5-17**].
The family was present (husband and son).  The attending was
notified by E-mail and phone.  Autopsy was deferred by the
patient's family and the cause of death was respiratory
distress secondary to metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.

2.  Deep venous thrombosis:  The patient had a deep venous
thrombosis on the site of the Port-A-Cath on the right.  The
patient's Lovenox and Coumadin were held during her hospital
stay.

3.  Hypotension in PACU in the setting of Propofol.  The
patient's A line did not always correlate with her manual
cuff, but her maps remained above 65 until her aim of care
changed at which time the patient became hypotensive.

4.  FEN:  The patient received maintenance fluids, D5 one
half normal saline until she was pronounced.

Communication was with her husband Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 38793**] [**Last Name (Titles) 38794**] and
her son.

Chief Complaint:
tracheal stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
balloon dilation of trachea

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 51 yoF w/ widely metastatic NSCLC ([**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], liver,
kidney) p/w tracheal narrowing. She presented to her oncologist
this a.m. c/o right shoulder pain X 2 days, intermittent
dysphagia (solids >liquids) X 1 week, and ""difficulty breathing
in"" X 5 days. She was noted to have stridor (concerning for
tracheal compression) and elevated JVP (concerning for early SVC
syndrome) and was admitted for further evaluation/management.
She had a total spine MRI which showed collapse of T1 c/w a
pathological fracture with anterior edema as well as evidence of
metastases at T10, T12, left L5 lamina, and left sacral ala.
However, there was no evidence of significant cord compression
or neural foraminal narrowing. She also had a chest CT which
showed marked progression of disease with a large mass invading
the right aspect of the mediastinal with significant narrowing
of the distal trachea (and possible invasion), encasement of the
lateral aspect of the SVC, esophagus, and right SC vessels, as
well as evidence of lymphagitic spread within the lungs. She
received dexamethasone 10 mg IV X 1 and was admitted to the ICU
for close monitoring to ensure airway stability prior to planned
bronchoscopy/tracheal stenting in a.m.
In [**Location 31038**] rigid bronch [**2-13**] vertebral issues, and no flex
bronch-trach stent given nickel allergy(stent is nickel),
therefore had balloon dilatation.  Ortho-spine
following---recommended brace, intervention only if neuro
changes, no signs cord compression now.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 51 yo female, with widely metastatic non-small cell lung
cancer, presenting with tracheal narrowing and ?cord
compression, no invervention tried, pt eventually made CMO and
passed away.

1.  Metastatic Lung cancer: On presentation, she had ?cord
compression and tracheal narrowing.  Steroids were initially
administered for ?cord compression (no definite evidence on
spinal MRI).  She had balloon dilation of her trachea, but
flexible and rigid bronchoscopy with stenting could not be
performed.  Rigid could not be performed [**2-13**] spinal disease, and
flexible could not be performed [**2-13**] nickel allergy to stent that
would be used.  Radiation oncology was consulted for possible
radiation of the trachea for the narrowing.  The decision was
made, however,  to make the patient DNR/DNI and CMO (made by her
family).  She was then put on a morphine drip with the dose
titrated up as necessary.  Scolopamine patch was also used.  She
passed away on [**2154-2-14**] at 1:35 pm.  As per her husband, autopsy
will be performed.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 73-year-old gentleman who
presented with a right lower lobe tumor on a recent CT scan.
The scarring of his lung had been followed two years prior
from a chest x-ray.  He had some complaints of back pain this
year with loss of balance.   Occasionally, his ambulation had
been reduced to approximately one-half mile which brought on
angina in addition to any exertion like walking up a [**Doctor Last Name **].
He had a recent cardiac catheterization which showed an
ejection fraction of approximately 20% with multiple blocked
arterial vessels.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myocardial infarction in [**2139**].
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2145**].
3.  Redo coronary artery bypass graft in [**2152**].
4.  Angioplasty in [**2163**]; the patient still occasionally has
angina; he had several angioplasties in [**2163**].
5.  A very recent smoking history.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN which caused a question of
hyperthermia and STATINS which cause leg cramps.  He also
listed METHANOL as giving him a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications prior to admission
were aspirin, Colestid, captopril, and Lopressor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On examination, his lungs
were clear bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  His abdominal examination was soft.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   Preoperative laboratory work
showed a white blood cell count of 8.3, a hematocrit of 37.3,
platelet count of 356,000.  Glucose 67, BUN 22,
creatinine 1.3, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 25.  Anion gap of 19.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Preoperative chest x-ray showed
calcified mediastinal lymph nodes and a vague opacity only
seen on the AP view.  The ill-defined opacity was in the
right base.  The examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Please refer to his final chest x-ray report.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with some
supraventricular extra systoles and a left bundle-branch
block.

PLAN:  The plan was for him to have a mediastinoscopy and
thoracoscopy with a question of a right lower lobectomy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] did note his increased risk of operation and
discussed it with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Cardiology who recommended
that it would reasonable to go ahead with monitoring,
although the risk was increased.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**10-7**] he underwent a
bronchoscopy mediastinal thoracoscopy and a right left lower
lobectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**].  He was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  He
was seen by the Acute Pain Service for follow up of his
epidural.

On postoperative day one, he was extubated.  He had been on a
little bit of Neo-Synephrine.  His central venous pressure
line was changed.  He was in sinus rhythm with premature
contractions in the 60s with a temperature maximum of 99.7.
He was satting reasonably well on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
He had no pleural leak and had 80 cc from his chest tube.
His hematocrit was 31.8.  He was neurologically intact.  He
had decreased breath sounds at the right lower lobe, but was
clear on the left.  His examination was otherwise
unremarkable.  He started pulmonary toilet.  His epidural
remained in place.  His calcium and magnesium were down
slightly.  His electrolytes were repleted.  His
Neo-Synephrine was weaned to off.  He started p.o. as
tolerated.  His Foley remained in place.  He was transferred
to the floor after weaning of his Neo-Synephrine.  He was
followed by the Acute Pain Service for his epidural.  He was
seen by Physical Therapy for help with his ambulation.  He
was seen by Case Management.

On postoperative day two, he was hemodynamically stable.  His
lungs were clear.  His heart was irregularly irregular.  His
chest tubes had a small air leak.  His abdominal was benign.
His extremities were warm.  A chest x-ray was checked to see
if there was a pneumothorax with plans to pull his chest
tubes if there was no pneumothorax as there was minimal chest
tube output.  He continued to work with Physical Therapy on
the floor.

On postoperative day three, he was sitting up comfortably.
He was afebrile with good vital signs.  His urine output was
good.  His lungs were clear.  His heart was regular in rate
and rhythm.  His abdominal examination benign with minimal
swelling in his extremities.  His chest tubes had been pulled
the evening prior.  His Foley catheter was removed in the
morning.  His epidural was removed.  He was ambulating well.
His central line was discontinued with plans for discharge in
the morning, and he was discharged to home on [**10-11**]
with the following discharge diagnoses.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Status post right lower lobectomy, bronchoscopy,
mediastinoscopy, mediastinal fluoroscopy.

FINDINGS: The kidneys are normal in contour and echogenicity
with no evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, or stones. The right
kidney measures 11.5 cm and the left kidney measures 12 cm. The
bladder was emptied during the study.

There is a small amount of ascites and gallstones are noted.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2177-6-10**]   :Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are grossly normal (LVEF>55%). Due
to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot
be excluded.

Chief Complaint:
Presumed lung cancer, transfer for palliative stenting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with stent placement [**2150-11-13**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 60 y/o f with schizophrenia, htn, chf, copd,
and a 50+ pack year smoking history who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2150-11-4**] from [**Location (un) 1036**] NH with sob and
hypoxia, was given a presumptive dx of lung cancer, and is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for palliative stenting.

She began to complain of shortness of breath and was found to be
hypoxic (94% on 2Lnc) at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] ED.
During the admission, she was noted to have a left peri-hilar
mass on CXR as well as a left pleural effusion, and a chest CT
revealed a 3.5x5cm left suprahilar mass with impingment on the
LUL bronchus and subsequent LUL collapse. She underwent
bronchoscopy showing a large lesion involving the left mainstem
bronchus and completely obstructing the LUL take-off. On the
following day, a chest x-ray showed total white-out of the left
lung. Her course was also complicated by the onset of new atrial
fibrillation, for which she was treated with diltiazem and sent
over on an IV amiodarone load. She also was hyponatremic and was
fluid restricted for presumed SIADH, and started on sodium tabs.

On admission, she had no complaints. Occasional complaint of
chest tightness that she's been having off and on for days, not
severe, no sob, no f/c. She has a mild productive cough,
unchanged over the past few days.

Past Medical History:
1.)Chronic schizophrenia
2.)Bipolar disorder
3.)Seizure disorder
4.)Etoh abuse
5.)Diastolic CHF
6.)Hypertension
7.)COPD
8.)50+ pack year tobacco abuse history

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**11-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally enhancing lobulated mass causing
obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus and resulting in
complete collapse/consolidation of the left upper lobe. The left
lower lobe bronchus remains patent, and the left lower lobe
remains aerated.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion, with minimal compressive
atelectasis on aerated left lower lobe.
3. Tiny 3 to 4 mm nodular densities within the right lung base.
Attention to this area should be paid on subsequent followup
exams.
4. Low-density lesion adjacent to falciform ligament most likely
represents focal fatty infiltration. Attention to this area
should be paid on followup exams.
5. Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
6. Tiny low-density lesions within both kidneys, which are too
small to adequately characterize.
*
[**2150-11-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2150-11-8**]:
Left upper lobe has reexpanded. Left lower lobe still collapsed
around the left hilar mass accompanied by small left pleural
effusion. Mediastinum midline. Heart normal size. Right lung
clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 60 year-old female with long-standing smoking
history with newly diagnosed lung mass obstructing LUL with
consequent collapse, transferred initially to MICU, then floor
for further work-up and care.

1) Lung mass: Her presentation with long-standing smoking, lung
mass, and presumptive SIADH was highly concerning for
malignancy, and an appropriate work-up was continued. A CT chest
performed on [**11-10**] revealed a 3.4 x 2.9 cm peripherally
enhancing lobulated mass causing obstruction of the left upper
lobe bronchus and resulting in complete collapse/consolidation
of the left upper lobe, with patent LLL bronchus. A moderate
left pleural effusion was also seen. Pleural fluid cytology from
the OSH thoracentesis returned negative for malignancy, although
only a small amount of fluid was obtained at that time. BAL
brushings from the OSH returned highly suspicious for squamous
cell cancer, which was felt diagnostic. She underwent a rigid
bronchoscopy on [**11-12**], with findings significant for tumor
infiltration of the submucosa in left mainstem bronchus, with
LUL/lingula completely obstructed. Stenting of the distal left
main stem bronchus (2mm uncovered stent) was performed.
LUL/lingula completely obstructed and unable to open. She
tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
CXR PA/lat post-procedure without complications.

Work-up otherwise remarkable for negative head CT, abdominal CT
without liver mets, bilateral adrenal adenomas. She does have a
pleural effusion, likely malignant, and is awaiting an
out-patient PET scan to complete her metastatic work-up and
assess disease burden. Hematology-Oncology was consulted in
house, with impression of unresectability. She may benefit from
XRT, which will be addressed as an out-patient. Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] has
a poor understanding of her disease, and as such complicates
matters in trying to obtain consent.

She will follow-up with Hematology/Oncology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
or [**Doctor Last Name 3274**] as an out-patient.

2) Dyspnea: Felt secondary to above. She also has a history of
COPD, and was initially placed on a higher dose of Prednisone 40
mg PO QD for possible COPD exacerbation upon admission to the
MICU. COPD was ultimately not felt to be an important
contributor, and quick Prednisone taper was initiated. She is
now down to her usual dose of 10 mg PO QD. We contact[**Name (NI) **] the
patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] indicated that she is on chronic low dose
Prednisone 10 mg PO QD. Continue supportive care with nebulizers
prn, MDIs. NO LASIX.

4) Atrial fibrillation: She was loaded on amiodarone IV at the
OSH, completed at [**Hospital1 18**]. She was subsequently placed on
Amiodarone 200 mg PO TID. she was also on a Diltiazem drip at
the OSH, converted to Verapamil upon transfer. She reverted to
NSR while in the ICU on [**11-10**], then back in afib on [**11-11**] with
RVR with HR in 140s, and borderline low BP. She was given
Diltiazem push IV X 3 doses, then Verapamil was changed to
Diltiazem 60 mg PO QID for easier titration. Amiodarone was also
increased to 400 mg PO TID. She converted back to NSR on [**11-11**],
and has remained in NSR since. She is back on 200 mg PO TID, and
should continue this dose X 1 week ([**11-20**]), then decrease to 200
mg PO BID X 1 week, then daily thereafter. She is back on
Verapamil 120 mg PO Q 12 hours. Decision was made not to
anticoagulate given her lung mass and concern over
friability/bleeding. However, no such evidence on bronch. She
currently remains in NSR, and per discussion with attending, no
anticoagulation at present. Of note, we have been avoiding
Albuterol nebulizers to prevent med-induced tachycardia.

5) Hyponatremia: Urine electrolytes with elevated urine sodium,
high urine osm, and low serum sodium was consistent with SIADH.
Renal was consulted, who confirmed the diagnosis. Her sodium has
improved in the hospital with fluid restriction 1200 cc/day.
Lasix was avoided, and IV fluids were used only sparingly for
lowish BP, now stable. A random cortisol level of 21 ruled out
adrenal insufficiency.

6) Psych: She was continued on her out-patient regiment of
Risperidone, valproic acid (level therapeutic on admission).
Bupropion inadvertently held during admission, restarted at
discharge. Poor grasp of diagnosis.

7) Code: Patient remained full code throughout her hospital
course. Her brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] is her HCP.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for right upper lobe small
cell cancer stage III, status post chemotherapy and
radiation, status post right upper lobe sleeve resection
[**6-19**], also with past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer status post radical
prostatectomy, GERD, TIA 15 years ago, gout and COPD. The
patient has no known drug allergies.  The patient is status
post right upper lobe lung sleeve resection on [**6-19**] for small
cell lung cancer.  The patient was discharged home doing well
until four days prior to admission when he presented to the
Emergency Room with shortness of breath and fevers.  The
patient was given Levaquin and was then discharged home
again.  He continued having shortness of breath and
productive cough.  He was admitted [**7-11**] for a follow-up
bronchoscopy during which time they found a right middle lobe
obstruction secondary to swelling.  After the procedure the
patient had shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of
88 as well as rigors and chills.  The patient was also found
to have poor color.  The patient's O2 saturation improved.
Chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was admitted.  The
patient underwent surgery [**2175-7-15**].  The patient underwent
completion pneumonectomy, bronchoscopy and serratus flap
closure of right main stem bronchus.

Postoperative day #1 the patient was afebrile with heart rate
of 56, blood pressure 104/56, satting at 99%.  Chest tube
output 500 cc.  Last gas 7.33, 56, 152, 31 and 100%.  On exam
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Incision,
dressings were clean, dry and intact. Heart was regular rate
and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, non distended.
Extremities had no swelling. White count 13.4, hematocrit
38.5, platelet count 394,000, potassium 4.8, BUN 13,
creatinine .6 with glucose of 188, magnesium 1.8 and CPK of
1410.  Plan was to wean the oxygen and check an ABG later on
and continue the pneumonectomy tube.  To check an EKG because
of the EKG change this morning in which patient had ST
segment elevations, undergo rule out MI protocol.

Postoperative day #2 the patient had no events over the last
24 hours, patient remained afebrile.  Heart rate 60, normal
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 105/58, satting at 97% on four
liters, last gas 7.39, 52, 96, 33.  Laboratory data revealed
white count 13.2, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count 322,000, PT
12.9, PTT 25.7, INR 1.1, potassium 4.7, BUN 15, creatinine .5
with glucose 158 and magnesium 1.7.  CK, 840.  Chest x-ray
pending.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to administer
Lasix today after transfer to the floor.  Infectious disease
came by to see the patient postop day #2 as well because they
were requested to recommend an antibiotic for the right
infiltrate to prevent the possibility of a postoperative
empyema.  Their recommendation was to continue with the
current IV antibiotics.  Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone will be
present. In the remote chance of postoperative infection
empyema these antibiotics will be present in the cavity and
also by peripheral circulation.

Postoperative day #3, events over the last 24 hours include
atrial fibrillation.  Patient mildly febrile at 99.2, heart
rate 57 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 102/42, respirations
14, satting at 97% on four liters, last gas 7.47, 46, 86, 34,
8 and 97%.  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5, platelet count
331,000, INR 1.1, PTT  28, potassium 3.9, BUN 14, creatinine
.5, glucose 141.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to
check the PT, PTT and to get a chest x-ray today and to
continue 20 mg of Lasix.  ID came by to see the patient again
today at which time they stated that the patient is already
on broad coverage for the lung abscess.  Strep and staff
improving, the tubes will be discontinued after the
antibiotics.  Follow-up of sensitivities on the culture and
anticipate a three week course of antibiotics.

Postoperative day #4, events overnight include a bronchoscopy
which was negative for fistula.  Stump was intact, positive
secretions.  The patient remained afebrile with a heart rate
of 57, sinus rhythm, sinus brady.  Blood pressure 136/68,
satting at 100% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  White count 8.8,
hematocrit 29.8, platelet count 375,000, cultures from [**7-15**]
grew out streptococcus, coag positive staph.  Physical exam
was benign.  ID again came by to see the patient at which
time they stated that they were awaiting final staph aureus
sensitivities before providing the direction of therapy.

Postoperative day #5 the patient remained afebrile, heart
rate 65 and sinus, blood pressure 106/60, satting at 95% on
room air.  Chest tubes were discontinued.  Urine output 1700.
Physical exam was benign.  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5,
platelet count 337,000, potassium 3.9, BUN 14, creatinine .5
with a glucose of 141, magnesium 2.1.

Postoperative day #6 on Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin overnight
events include atrial fibrillation and heparinization for
possible PE and a chest CT scan.  Patient on Amio and
Heparin, afebrile, heart rate 108 and atrial fibrillation,
blood pressure 96/68, satting at 97% on three liters.
Hematocrit 37, PTT 28.4, potassium 4.2.  Physical exam, lungs
were irregularly irregular, otherwise unremarkable.

Postoperative day #7 the patient remained afebrile, heart
rate 56, blood pressure 109/65, satting at 97% on two liters.
On Lopressor, Lasix, Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin and Amiodarone,
PTT of 28.  Physical exam unremarkable.  The day prior the
patient underwent a spiral CT of the chest to rule out a PE.
There was radiographic evidence for peripheral pulmonary
emboli in the left lung, patient on Heparin.  ID again came
by to see the patient at which time they stated that the
patient was clinically stable from an ID perspective and to
continue the antibiotic regimen for a total of 14 days.  If
the patient spikes a fever they were to be consulted again.

Postoperative day #8 the patient remained afebrile, vital
signs stable, blood pressure 116/74, satting at 99% on 4
liters.  Exam was benign.  Plan was to check the PTT.
Patient is still on Heparin.

Postoperative day #9 the patient remained afebrile with a
heart rate of 63 and sinus rhythm, respirations 18, satting
at 96% on 3 liters, blood pressure 122/70.  The patient was
on Heparin, Lopressor, Amiodarone, Clindamycin, Ceftriaxone
and Coumadin.  On physical exam, exam was benign.  Plan was
to check the INR, PTT and to continue aggressive pulmonary
PT.  Postoperative day #9, overnight events include atrial

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
male with an extensive past medical history, as noted above
in the admission and discharge diagnoses, who has been having
recurrent right pleural effusions postoperatively after his
coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement
in [**2129-10-15**].  Initially, this was attributed
secondary to Dressler's syndrome which he had postoperatively
which was treated successfully with Lasix and prednisone.
These effusions continued to return.  He had them tapped in
[**2129-12-16**] and [**2131-3-15**] which initially relieved his
symptoms of dyspnea.  The patient did undergo a cardiac
echocardiogram which did not show evidence of CHF as the
etiology of this.

From his pleural taps, his fluid analysis was negative.  The
patient continues to have some dyspnea on exertion which is
worsening and chest CT which was obtained to evaluate this
showed a loculated right effusion.  He presents for
evaluation of the etiology of this by lung biopsy and
possible decortication.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient is 5' 8"" tall
and his weight is 175 pounds.  Vital signs:  Temperature
95.2, pulse 86 and regular, sinus rhythm, respiratory rate
20, SP02 97% on room air, otherwise blood pressure 155/76.
General: The patient was alert and oriented.  HEENT:  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The
extraocular movements were full.  The oropharynx was
nonerythematous.  The neck revealed scars consistent with
previous biopsies but there were no palpable nodes and there
was no JVD.  The chest was notable for prior sternotomy scar
and right posterior incision from prior surgery.  The breath
sounds were dull and decreased from the right base to the
midfield on the right.  The left was clear.  Cardiac:  He was
in regular sinus rhythm without any murmur, gallop, or rub
appreciated.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender.  There was no mass
or hepatosplenomegaly palpable.  Extremities:  The lower
extremities revealed mild bilateral edema on the right and
there was a scar consistent with a prior right vein harvest.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On the date of admission, the
patient's white count was 6.5 with a hematocrit of 33.4,
platelet count 203,000.  The urinalysis was without evidence
of infection.  His admitting potassium was 4.0 with a BUN and
creatinine of 33 and 1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2131-6-4**] preoperatively.  The patient was taken to the
Operating Room on the date of admission, [**2131-6-4**], but
the notable EKG changes of T wave inversion and ST segment
depression in II and aVF with ST segment elevation in V1 and
V2 forced the surgery to be cancelled and the patient was
evaluated by Cardiology to rule out MI.  Cardiology had the
patient undergo MI protocol and serial enzymes were obtained
which did not evidence an acute ischemic event.  He also
underwent an ETT-MIBI the next day which was performed and
did not show any evidence of ventricular wall abnormality or
ischemia and subsequently Cardiology cleared this patient for
surgery.

He was subsequently taken to the Operating Room on [**2131-6-6**] where intraoperatively, the patient went into sudden
asystole which was treated by intraoperative atropine and
chest compressions.  Epinephrine was subsequently given.  It
was noted that the patient subsequently went into a
third-degree AV block and blood pressure returned to a
rebound hypertension which required redosing of
nitroglycerin.  The patient continued to remain in a heart
block and bradycardiac and, therefore, transcutaneous pacing
was initiated to which the patient did respond.  V pace was
placed and the patient was V paced at 90 beats per minute and
remained stable.  This occurred towards the end of the
procedure and the incision was subsequently closed and the
patient was taken to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit where
he remained intubated, sedate, and V paced with a stable
blood pressure.

He did have an intraoperative TEE to guide the treatment
which showed an EF of 40-45% with question of dyskinesis of
the septum and anterior septal walls which was difficult to
determine if it was related to previous cardiac surgery.
There was note of mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction
and moderate MR.

Cardiology evaluated the patient immediately postoperatively
in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit and discussed his
complete heart block.  Notably, the overall time for CPR was
2-3 minutes.

When the patient arrived to the CSRU, he was in normal sinus
rhythm at 80 beats per minute with a blood pressure of
120/70.  While in the CSRU, the patient continued with
temporary pacing wires pending further evaluation by the
Electrophysiology Service.  These were switched to stable 6F
pacer wires on the evening of postoperative day number zero.
The patient remained stable in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery
Unit on postoperative day number two and three.  He did have
an episode of acute renal insufficiency which was thought to
be prerenal secondary to dehydration in which the patient's
creatinine did subsequently recover after hydration was
given.

The patient remained clinically stable through postoperative
day number five on which the patient had a pacemaker
inserted.  This was a [**Company 1543**] pacemaker, [**Company 1543**] Sigma
SDR 303.  There was note of intraprocedural complication and
the patient was subsequently transferred to the floor from
the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit the next day.  He did not
have any further episodes of asystole and he remained on
telemetry on the floor.  As the patient had been doing well
postoperatively and subsequent to his pacemaker insertion it
was determined that he could be discharged to home with
proper follow-up as outlined previously with Cardiology and
with Thoracic Surgery.

At the time of discharge, his hematocrit was 27.1 with a
white count of 5.3 and platelet count of 255,000.  His
potassium was 4.4 with a BUN and creatinine of 24 and 1.4.
Blood cultures remained negative throughout the course of his
hospitalization.  The patient's chest x-ray showed some
bilateral pleural effusions but these were described as small
to moderate and noted to be improved.

FOLLOW-UP:  He is set to follow-up with the [**Hospital **] Clinic on
[**2131-6-21**] and he is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in one
week from the date of discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg once a day.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg once a day.
3.  Prednisone 5 mg once a day.
4.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets every four to six hours
as needed.
5.  Colace one tablet twice a day as needed.
6.  Continue on Fosamax 70 mg once per week, aspirin 81 mg
once a day, and his Novolin 30 units, 20 in the morning, 10
in the evening, and Humalog 8 units, 4 units in the morning,
4 units in the evening for his diabetes.

DISPOSITION:   At the time of discharge, the patient is doing
quite well clinically.  He has tolerated insertion of his
pacemaker without any notes of arrhythmia.  He is ambulating,
respiring well.  As mentioned, he will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in the [**Hospital **] Clinic.

19355,155180,LUNG CANCER/AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION,"Admission Date: [**2112-3-9**]        Discharge Date: [**2112-3-11**]


Service:  MICU


The patient was admitted on [**2112-3-9**]. The patient
expired on [**2112-3-11**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 82-year-old
female, with a history of smoking, who presented as a
transfer from an outside hospital for bronchoscopy and stent
placement. The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in
[**2112-2-2**] complaining of [**2-5**] days of a nonproductive cough,
as well as increasing dyspnea, mainly on exertion. The
patient had an x-ray done which was suspicious for a right
lower lobe infiltrate and was admitted to the hospital for
treatment of pneumonia. A CT scan done during the
hospitalization showed right lower lobe and middle lobe post
obstructive consolidation. There was also a complete
obliteration of the right bronchus intermedius and narrowing
and constriction of the right pulmonary artery. There were
multiple small nodules in the right upper lobe and several
left sided ground glass nodules. It was thought that these
findings were likely secondary to cancer, although other
granulomatous disease was also possible. The patient was seen
by a pulmonologist at the outside hospital, and it was felt
that there was a probable endobronchial mass consistent with
lung cancer with obstruction in the right lower lobe, as well
as left mainstem bronchi compression and pulmonary artery
compression. At that time, the plan was to proceed with
outpatient bronchoscopy.
The patient came in to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-3-8**] for a flexible
bronchoscopy. This bronchoscopy showed obstruction of the
bronchus intermedius and lower lobe, with severe tumor
involvement of the carina, as well as right and left sided
involvement. Secondary to tumor involvement, there was
narrowing of the left mainstem bronchus to 5 mm. The patient
was then taken to the operating room for a rigid
bronchoscopy. Balloon dilatation and stent placement were
performed in the left mainstem bronchus. The patient remained
intubated after the procedure due to the severity of the
condition and a prolonged procedure and was transferred to
the medical ICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  COPD.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Combivent inhaler.
2.  Calcium.
3.  Vitamin D.
4.  Multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a heavy smoker quitting 2
years ago. No history of alcohol or IV drug use. She lived
alone and had 4 children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
afebrile, with a blood pressure of 91/56, heart rate of 84,
respiratory rate of 18, and O2 sat of 98%. General: The
patient was a frail elderly woman lying in bed intubated.
HEENT exam: Normocephalic and atraumatic with pupils equally
round and reactive. Sclerae anicteric and oropharynx clear,
with the ET tube in place. Lungs: Crackles bilaterally and
coarse breath sounds. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended,
with normal active bowel sounds. Extremities showed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Extremities were warm and well
perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC showed a white count of 12.6,
hematocrit of 44 and platelets of 344. Chem 7 was within
normal limits. Initial ABG was pH 7.38, PCO2 of 41, and PAO2
of 68 on assist control with a tidal volume of 400,
respiratory rate of 16, PEEP of 8 and FIO2 of 0.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure: The patient's
respiratory failure was secondary to extensive lung cancer
and bronchial obstruction. During the bronchoscopy, she did
have a stent placed in the left mainstem bronchus. Due to her
extensive malignancy, it was felt that her prognosis would be
very poor. It was also likely that she would be able to be
extubated successfully. Family discussion was conducted and
the patient's poor prognosis was relayed to the family. At
this time, it was decided to make the patient Comfort
Measures Only. Per the family's wishes, the patient was
extubated and started on a morphine drip for comfort. This
was done on the afternoon of [**2112-3-10**]. The patient died
on [**2112-3-11**] at 5:20 a.m. At that time, she was
unresponsive to voice or pain. Pupils were fixed and dilated.
There were no breath or heart sounds. The patient was
pronounced dead at 5:20 a.m. The patient's so was present at
the time of death and the daughter was notified by the son. A
post mortem examination was declined by the family.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Lung cancer.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old gentleman
status post left lower lobe lung lobectomy who was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit team from the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit team on [**2173-10-30**] for
failure to wean off ventilation.

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of
throat cancer who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2173-5-28**] for leg claudication and at that time
an admission chest x-ray showed right upper lobe and left
lower lobe lung masses.  At that time he had a right upper
lobe wedge resection and pleural biopsy which was negative
for malignancy on pathology, and he also had a negative bone
scan and head MRI for metastatic disease.

In [**Month (only) 216**] of this year he was admitted again for an
uncomplicated left femoral peroneal bypass surgery for his
leg claudication, and further workup at that time revealed a
left lower lobe 3-cm mass.  So, he was electively admitted on
[**2173-10-15**] for a left lower lobectomy.  He had no
immediate complications post surgery and was easily
extubated.  However, on postoperative day one he had an
episode of atrial fibrillation and hypotension, and he was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  A Swan-Ganz catheter
was placed with initial of right atrium 4, pulmonary artery
pressure of 38/14, cardiac output of 5.9, cardiac index
of 3.2, and systemic vascular resistance of 1038.  He was
aggressively volume resuscitated and then intubated for
progressive respiratory distress.  A Neo-Synephrine drip was
initiated.  He also had several bronchoscopies during this
admission which showed multiple mucous plugs and left upper
lobe collapse.  Sputum from the bronchoscopy grew Klebsiella
and Serratia which were pan sensitive, and he was started on
ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.  He was briefly extubated
between [**10-21**] and [**10-22**]; however, he was
reintubated for respiratory distress on [**10-22**].  His
chest x-ray showed progressive bilateral multilobar pneumonia
versus acute respiratory distress syndrome.  Efforts at
weaning were limited by secretions, high oxygen requirement,
and increased respiratory rate if pressure support was
decreased, and he was requested to be transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has two sons who are actively involved in his life.
He has a history of tobacco for 40 years and quit 20 years
ago.  He is an occasional alcohol drinker.  Prior to this
admission the patient was in a wheelchair with a decreased
quality of life that he was unhappy with.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs were

ST-T wave changes.

Echocardiogram stress in [**2173-5-28**] showed an ejection
fraction of 60% to 70%, no wall motion abnormalities, no
ischemia.

Left lower lobe pathology revealed squamous cell carcinoma
with no lymph node involvement.

IMPRESSION:  A 77-year-old gentleman status post left lower
lobectomy on postoperative day 15 with diffuse alveolar
infiltrates and consolidations suggestive of pneumonia
bilaterally; now with difficulty weaning from mechanical
ventilation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

 1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was status post left lower
lobectomy.   This fact, and his diffuse pneumonia would cause
a decrease in ventilation.  The patient was hypoxic on an
FIO2 of 5.55.  He also had a decreased compliance suggestive
of possible acute respiratory distress syndrome.  His
hypercarbia was secondary to poorly ventilated areas of his
lungs.  He was followed on arterial blood gas and was on
assist control ventilation while in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  He became progressively acidotic by his followed
arterial blood gas, and his set respiratory rate was
increased to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.  He was
continued on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime for his
Serratia/Klebsiella pneumonia.  A repeat chest x-ray showed
continuation of diffuse alveolar infiltrations bilaterally,
left greater than right.  His metabolic acidosis was most
likely secondary to his progressive renal failure.

On the night of [**10-31**], he was started on a bicarbonate
drip given his worsening acidosis.  His lactate was 1.5.  It
was decided to increase his sedation by increasing the amount
of Ativan he was receiving and morphine he was receiving.  On
[**11-1**], his morphine was changed to Fentanyl.  With
increased sedation his arterial blood gas results remained
steady, and he seemed to be more in synchronization with the
ventilation.

 2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  RHYTHM:  His of atrial
fibrillation during this hospitalization with rapid
ventricular rate.  He was started on procainamide drip by the
surgical team; however, since postoperative day one he had
normal runs of atrial fibrillation and once he was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
procainamide drip stopped.  He had no more runs of atrial
fibrillation under the Medical Intensive Care Unit's care.

The patient was hypotensive; thought to be secondary to
possible sepsis.  However, in order to rule out cardiogenic
shock, and echocardiogram was done on [**11-1**] which was
within normal limits.  The Neo-Synephrine drip was unable to
be weaned off; and in fact, because of his progressive
hypotension, vasopressin drip was added on [**10-31**].  He
was also given intravenous fluids boluses which only helped
temporarily to support his blood pressure.

On [**11-1**], his Neo-Synephrine drip was changed to
Levophed drip for more beta agonist effects.  Cortisol was
added to his laboratories to check for adrenal insufficiency
as an etiology for his hypotension.

 3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with multilobar
pneumonia with sputum growing Klebsiella and Serratia pan
sensitive.  He was continued on ciprofloxacin and
ceftazidime.  His subclavian tip grew vancomycin-sensitive
enterococcus and was removed.  He was given one dose of
vancomycin for this at 1 g.  Blood cultures did not grow
anything to date.

On [**10-31**], two more blood cultures were checked as they
were on [**11-1**] given his rising temperature.  Urine
cultures were also negative to date.  His white blood cell
count continued to rise despite his antibiotic treatment, and
with his hypotension this was consistent with a septic
picture.  A sputum culture was sent on [**11-1**].


 4.  RENAL:  The patient developed progressive acute renal
failure.  This was thought to be secondary to acute tubular
necrosis from his hypotension.  His kidneys did not seem to
respond well to intravenous fluids boluses.  Urine
electrolytes were checked, and his FENa was calculated at
1.3; not consistent with a prerenal etiology.  Free water was
restricted and all intravenous medications were placed in
normal saline.  All of his medications were renally doses on
[**11-1**], and his urine output progressively decreased and
became darker in coloration.

 5.  ONCOLOGY:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung; staging
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] lymph node involvement.

 6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was on total parenteral
nutrition.  He had a Dobbhoff feeding tube in place situated
correctly in post pyloric; however, because of his increasing
liver function tests tube feeds were held off, and then they
were never started because of his lack of bowel sounds and
lack of peristalsis.  He was continued on total parenteral
nutrition.  The patient's liver function tests were also
noted to be increasing, particularly his AST, alkaline
phosphatase, and direct bilirubin.  This was thought to be
secondary to mixed picture of shocked liver versus
obstructive due to total parenteral nutrition versus
ceftazidime or other medications causing hepatic obstruction.

Enzyme elevation:  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done
on [**10-31**] which revealed no gallbladder wall thickening
or pericholecystic fluid, no biliary obstruction.  Coarse
hypoechoic appearance to the liver which was suggestive of
fatty liver versus other forms of liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis; unchanged from his
previous right upper quadrant.

Because of his increasing blood glucose levels the amount of
insulin in his total parenteral nutrition was increased
accordingly.

 7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable
while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, although he did
require 2 units of packed red blood cells transfusion on
[**10-29**] under the surgical team's care.  Hemolysis
laboratories were negative and reticulocyte count was 4,
indicating an appropriate bone marrow response to anemia.
Rectal examination was empty of stool, and therefore could
not be guaiaced.  However, he did have diarrhea on [**11-1**]
which was guaiac-negative.  Clostridium difficile toxin was
sent on his diarrhea.

 8.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was on total
parenteral nutrition.  His phosphorous was climbing with his
renal insufficiency, and therefore it was not added to his
total parenteral nutrition.  Tube feeds were not initiated.
His blood glucose did increase, most likely secondary to the
total parenteral nutrition and insulin was added to the total
parenteral nutrition.  An insulin drip was considered but
never started, although his insulin sliding-scale was
adjusted accordingly.

 9.  LINES:  Right subclavian line, left arterial line placed
on [**10-27**].  Peripheral access, Protonix, and subcutaneous
heparin.

10.  CODE STATUS:  When the patient was transferred from the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit his code was reported as full.  However, on [**11-1**] a
family meeting was called given his progressive multiorgan
failure.  I, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**], and the pulmonary critical care
fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33670**], met with the patient's wife and two sons
at 4 p.m. on [**11-1**] to discuss his medical status.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33671**] was present for the first portion of the
discussion.  It was explained to the family that
Mr. [**Known lastname 33672**] was in multisystem failure; namely:

1.  PULMONARY:  He was ventilator dependent, increasingly so,
requiring increased sedation to passively ventilate him.  His
respiratory status was complicated by his underlying lung
cancer.  His recent left lower lobectomy which reduced his
lung volumes, his multilobar pneumonia, and acute respiratory
distress syndrome.  He was approaching intubation for 10
days, and therefore if aggressive care was continued a
tracheostomy would be considered; however, in his current
status he may not tolerate a tracheostomy placement
especially given his underlying throat cancer.

2.  RENAL:  The patient was in worsening renal failure and
worsening acidosis as a result with decreased urine output,
and the next therapeutic step would be to involve the Renal
team and initiate hemodialysis.  They were also told that a
bicarbonate drip was started for his acidosis.

3.  HEMODYNAMICS:  Hemodynamic wise, he was hypotensive and
dependent on two pressors; namely, Levophed and vasopressin
drip to maintain his blood pressure.  He also had the history
of atrial fibrillation during his hospital stay.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Gastrointestinal wise, the patient
would not be able to be tubed fed yet and was dependent on
total parenteral nutrition which is not an ideal form of
nutrition.

5.  LIVER:  The patient has having increasing liver function
tests and was in moderate liver dysfunction.  It was
discussed that his prognosis was very grave given this
multisystem failure and that there was a small chance of
survival and recovery from this.

His wife brought with her the patient's living will which was
signed by him in [**2161**] in which he states that if he is in no
position to speak for himself and in a state from which there
was no hope of recovery he would desire no means of
life-sustaining methods including no artifical ventilation,
antibiotics or hemodialysis.  His wife reiterated that he has
verbally expressed this opinion to her in the recent past.
The patient was recently in acute acidotic coma, and when he
recovered expressed regret at surviving through hit.  Prior
to this admission he was handicapped in a wheelchair and
would not want to go back to his prior or worse quality of
life.  Her sons were in agreement of this and confirmed that
his status was do not resuscitate.

After leaving his wife and sons on their own to discuss their
father for 20 minutes they came to the decision to stop his
two pressors and leave everything else going.  His Levophed
drip and vasopressin drips were stopped at 6 p.m. on
[**11-1**] in his family's presence.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33670**] discussed
the family discussion with the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and he
was in full agreement with the plan.

The patient's blood pressure and heart rate continued to
decline off of the pressors, and at approximately 7:30 p.m.
his monitor showed a flat line.  The intern, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 33673**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was
called to pronounce him.  The patient was not breathing.  He
had no pulse.  Pupils were unreactive to light.  He did not
respond to noxious stimuli.  He had no breath sounds, and he
was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m.  The family declined an
autopsy and were informed of his death.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Stage 3-A lung cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a delightful 62
year old woman with a 90 pack year history of smoking.  She
presented with chronic cough, worse for a 15 month duration,
and a 13 pound weight loss.  She was found to have a poorly
differentiated non small cell lung cancer in the left upper
lobe, emanating from the lobar bronchus.  It measured 3 by
2.6 cm and was associated with bulky mediastinal adenopathy.
An otolaryngology examination confirmed the presence of vocal
cord paralysis.  Her chest CT scan showed no evidence of
liver or mediastinal involvement.  Bone scan was negative.
PET scan reportedly showed no evidence of metastatic
involvement in the periphery.  She was initially deemed
unresectable due to her bulky N2 disease and was started on
definitive chemoradiotherapy with Carboplatinum and Taxotere.
She did well and a recent CT scan showed a dramatic response
to the primary tumor as well as mediastinal lymph nodes.
Because of the significant reduction in mass, she was
discussed in the thoracic oncology multi-disciplinary center
and the consensus of the group was to move forward with an
attempt at surgical resection given her age and good health.
She was, therefore, admitted to the hospital for surgery.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the
operating room on [**2150-10-11**] and underwent a left
thoracotomy.  During the operation, she had severe damage to
her left lung from radiation therapy and her left lung became
extremely edematous and she developed hemorrhage into her
airways.  Because of the inability to oxygenate her, we
rapidly converted her over to a median sternotomy and
prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  In the end, this turned
out not to be necessary and we completed the operation
through the median sternotomy and then converted it back to
the thoracotomy for the final portions of it, which included
the latissimus dorsi flap.  She had initially difficult
postoperative course but eventually was discharged in
relatively good condition.  She left against medical advice
due to the fact that her son had committed suicide the day
before.  When she found out that this had happened, she left
against medical advice but she was in reasonably good health
at that time.

Service:  Fenard Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from outside hospital for
management of SVC syndrome.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 66 year old
female with a 50 pack year smoking history who presented with
six weeks of facial swelling.  The patient presented to the
outside hospital on [**2196-11-14**] with one month of facial
swelling, shortness of breath with minimal exertion and
blood-tinged sputum.  The patient had a chest computerized
tomography scan at the outside hospital which reportedly
showed an extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The patient
was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] for tissue diagnosis.
On [**2196-11-17**], a bronchoscopy showed abnormal mucosa in
the bronchus intermedius, however, biopsies were
nondiagnostic for malignancy.  A mediastinoscopy was then
done which revealed a firm lymph node mass directly inferior
to the innominate vein in the pretracheal and right
paratracheal region.  Biopsy of the mass was consistent with
nonsmall cell cancer and later reported as large cell lung
carcinoma.  After biopsy, significant bleeding was seen and
this incision site was packed with Surgicel.  Bleeding ceased
but the patient was kept intubated for airway protection.  A
repeat bronchoscopy showed narrowing of the trachea to 8 mm.
No report of the bronchoscopy was sent with the hospital
discharge summary from [**Hospital3 **], therefore it is unclear
where this narrowing was visualized.  Radiology Oncology was
consulted at an outside hospital and plan was for radiation
to begin on [**11-19**].  However, because of the patient's
intubated state it was felt that the patient could not be
transported safely to and from the hospital.  She was started
on Solu-Medrol intravenously and transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for urgent radiation.
Hospital course at the outside hospital was significant for
hypertension requiring frequent doses of Labetalol.  The
patient also received large doses of sedation for agitation
including Fentanyl, Ativan, Morphine, Versed and two doses of
            .  Chest x-ray from the outside hospital was
consistent with interstitial edema and bibasilar air space
disease as per report.  Sputum cultures from the outside
hospital, positive for gram positive cocci.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
history of shoulder fracture in [**2182**].

MEDICATIONS AS AN OUTPATIENT:  Insulin, sliding scale in AM,
Valium prn and Aleve prn.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenously q.
6 hours, Protonix 40 mg intravenously q. 24 hours, insulin
sliding scale, heparin subcutaneously, Labetalol 5 to 10 mg
intravenously q. 1 hour prn, Versed 2 to 5 mg q. 1 hour prn,
Ativan 1 to 2 mg q. 1 hour prn, Morphine 4 to 8 mg q. 1 hour
prn, Ativan 2 to 4 mg q. 1 hour prn, Tylenol prn, Propofol
drip.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother deceased at age 75 from breast
carcinoma, father deceased at age 50 of cirrhosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  50 Pack year smoking history, recently quit,
lives alone and is a retired budget director.  Uses alcohol
occasionally.  Has a niece and cousin who live in the area
and has three siblings who live in [**State 531**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination temperature
95, heartrate 94, blood pressure 163/86, respiratory rate 20,
oxygen saturations 25% on 50% FIO2.  The patient came over on
SIMV with title volumes of 700, respiratory rate of 10,
pressure support of 5 and 5 with arterial blood gases of
7.39, 4, 5 and 70.  The patient was noted not to be
over-breathing the ventilator at this time.  In general the
patient is intubated and sedated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat, neck appears swollen symmetrically.  Jugulovenous
distension could not be assessed.  Cervical lymphadenopathy
could also not be assessed.  There is bilateral periorbital
edema.  Pupils are 2 mm and symmetric.  The patient also had
upper extremity edema bilaterally, right slightly greater
than left.  Heart distant due to rhonchi, could not be
assessed.  Lungs, diffuse rhonchi bilaterally.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities, positive
clubbing of nails in upper and lower extremities bilaterally,
positive varicose veins in lower extremities bilaterally.
Positive areas of erythematous silvery plaques on extensive
surfaces of the upper extremities.  There was notable 4+
upper extremity edema and no lower extremity edema.  There
was also shotty left groin adenopathy.  Breasts, right breast
with a peau d'orange appearance, however, no masses were
felt.  Approximately 1 cm left axillary node was palpated.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies from outside hospital
revealed arterial blood gases 7.27, 62 and 80 on SIMV 700,
rate of 8, pressure support of 10 and 5, rate was increased
to 10 after this gas was attained.  White blood cell count
5.8, hematocrit 35.7, platelets 82, MCV 95.  PT 15.3, PTT 34,
INR 1.3, fibrinogen 381, D-Dimer 1, no range was given,
however, this is marked as high.  Sodium 135, potassium 4.1,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, BUN 15, creatinine .5, glucose
266, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.8, iron 42, TIBC 249, ferritin
259.  Total bilirubin .3, ALT 24, AST 24, total protein 6.5,
albumin 3.4, alkaline phosphatase 129, Vitamin B 12 910,
Folate 10.6.  From [**11-17**], bronchial washings, gram
stains a few polys, a few gram positive cocci and culture
consistent with normal Flora.  Chest x-ray from outside
hospital per report, endotracheal tube with tip carinii,
cardiomegaly, right lower lobe infiltrate.  Chest x-ray from
outside report on [**11-18**], mild interstitial edema,
bibasilar air space disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary this is a 66 year old female
with newly diagnosed large cell lung carcinoma complicated by
SVC syndrome and airway obstruction who came to [**Hospital6 1760**] intubated.

Pulmonary - Large cell lung carcinoma complicated by SVC
syndrome and airway obstruction.  During this
hospitalization, the patient remained intubated until
hospital day #12.  Until hospital day #10 the patient was
noted not to have any air leak and it was thought that she
had extrinsic compression of her trachea by her diffuse
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The patient had a computerized
tomography scan of the trachea on [**11-28**] after eight to
nine doses of radiation which showed trachea that was patent
with improvement in its caliber and less extrinsic
compression seen on previous computerized tomography scan.
There was also continued evidence of soft tissue enhancement
of the trachea extending to the level of the right main stem
bronchus.  There were also multifocal areas of air space
opacities improved in some areas but worse in other areas
suggestive of multifocal aspiration or pneumonia and there
was also SVC obstruction.  After it was established that the
patient had a significant air leak, she had a bronchoscopy
done by Interventional Pulmonology which showed extrinsic
compression of the right middle lobe bronchus, however,
significant air movement was seen in the right middle lobe
bronchus and it was felt that the patient could be safely
extubated without need of stent in the right middle lobe
bronchus.  There was also noted to be copious secretions
consistent with a post obstructive pneumonia.  The patient
was extubated on hospital day #12 without complications.  She
required frequent suctioning due to secretions and required
both nasal cannula and high flow oxygen to maintain a
saturation above 90%.  It was thought that the patient had an
element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given her
smoking history and wheezing on examination.  She was started
on Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers which were [**2-13**] and then
spread out to prn by hospital day #16.  In terms of her right
middle lobe collapse, due to extrinsic compression and marked
middle lobe bronchus it was thought that the patient should
be carefully observed, however, stent was not needed at this
time.  It was also thought, that due to the patient's habitus
and paradoxical breathing pattern with sleeping that the
patient most likely had an element of sleep apnea.  The
patient was started on CPAP trials, however, she did not
tolerate the mask and has only been able to tolerate at
maximum two hours of CPAP at a setting of 8 cm.  We will
continue to try CPAP mask during the day if the patient can
tolerate.  It was also noted that the patient had a
persistent elevated right hemidiaphragm on serial chest
x-rays.  It was thought that due to the patient's cancer and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, that she most likely had
paralysis of the right phrenic nerve.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44983**] from the
Department of Anesthesia evaluated the patient's
diaphragmatic movement with ultrasound at the bedside.
Minimal right diaphragmatic movement was seen.  The patient
also had vital capacities done both supine and sitting up.
The patient's vital capacity decreased 50% in the supine
position.  The patient was kept in the upright position at
all times to maximize vital capacity.  In terms of the
patient's post obstructive pneumonia, the patient has been on
a course of Levaquin and Clindamycin.  At the time of this
dictation she is day #12 out of a set course of 21 days.  By
x-ray, chest computerized tomography scan, it appears that
the patient may be suffering from aspiration as well.  The
patient does not currently have a gag reflex, and a speech
and swallow study is pending at this time.  She has been kept
strict NPO.  The patient's mental status appears to be
approaching baseline and it is not thought that the patient
has lost her gag due to decreased mental status or medication
effect.  There may be involvement of tumor and loss of her
gag reflex.

On head computerized tomography scan no metastatic disease
was found, however, the patient had significant sinusitis
involving both maxillary sinuses.  The patient should
continue Levaquin for a 21 day course.  Her nasogastric tube
was discontinued which should improve drainage of her
secretions.

Delta Multiple sclerosis - It was noted that post extubation
the patient had confusion and delirium.  It was thought that
this is most likely due to medication effect as she required
doses of Ativan for radiation.  It was thought at this time
that since her mental status continued to improve, no other
source of delirium was likely.

Oncology - The patient had a chest computerized tomography
scan which showed a right middle lobe dominant lesion of
approximately 2 cm.  Given the lymph node biopsy of large
cell, carcinoma was thought most likely that the patient's
primary tumor is large cell lung carcinoma.  She has received
ten doses of radiation which the patient has tolerated well
and has shown some improvement of tumor size.  Medical
Oncology is currently following and is deciding on a course
of chemotherapy, once the patient's respiratory status
becomes more stable.

Hypernatremia - The patient had significant hypernatremia
during this admission with sodiums of up to 148.  The patient
has started on free water infusions and this has subsequently
improved.

Diabetes - The patient was on Solu-Medrol for a short period
of time, however, since this was not thought to be lymphoma,
Solu-Medrol was subsequently discontinued.  However, while
she was on Solu-Medrol the patient required an insulin drip.
The patient is currently on an insulin sliding scale,
however, is receiving dextrose in her partial parenteral
nutrition and is started on NPH 4 mg b.i.d.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient no longer
has an nasogastric tube and is pending a speech and swallow
evaluation.  She is started on partial parenteral nutrition
since her PICC line is not central enough for total
parenteral nutrition at this time.  After speech and swallow,
if she aspirates during her speech and swallow examination,
then the decision whether to pursue a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube will be approached with the patient at that
time.

Cardiac - Given that the patient has an enlarged cardiac
silhouette on chest x-ray and some evidence of interstitial
edema an echocardiogram was obtained.  This showed global HK
with an ejection fraction of approximately 45%.  The patient
has no known history of coronary artery disease.  Because of
the patient's SVC syndrome, diuresis was not pursued at this
time, however, once hypernatremia resolves, the patient may

Chief Complaint:
right shoulder - pain- RUL lung tumor for excision s/p
chemotherapy and radiation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right posterior and lateral thoracotomy, right upper
    lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection of ribs 2 and
    3.
2.  Right cervical incision with scalene fat pad and lymph
    node resection as well as mobilization of superior sulcus
    tumor off of 1st rib and division of the 2nd rib
    anteriorly.
3.  Thoracic lymphadenectomy.
4.  Flexible bronchoscopy.


History of Present Illness:
62-year-old woman who developed right shoulder pain and was
found to have a large right upper lobe tumor invading into the
2nd and 3rd ribs and abutting up against the 1st rib. She
underwent cervical mediastinoscopy as well as peripheral
metastatic workup. There were no positive lymph nodes and no
metastasis. She underwent induction of chemoradiotherapy to
shrink the tumor away from the subclavian artery and subclavian
vein as well as the brachial plexus. She has been restaged and
was found to have excellent response. We, therefore, took her
forward for a resection of the superior sulcus tumor. Our plan
was to biopsy the scalene fat pad and lymph nodes and if there
is no evidence of tumor to move on to mobilize the superior
sulcus tumor from the cervical incision, including division of
ribs as necessary. We would then move on to a posterolateral
thoracotomy for completion of the procedure.

Past Medical History:
Gastric esophogeal reflux disease, Coronary artery disease,
diabetes type 2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Non
small cell lung cancer s/p chemotherapy and radiation.

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13783**] is a 79-year-old
gentleman with some dyspnea on exertion that was admitted to
at one-half blocks for 10 years.  He has also complained of a
chronic cough and has a smoking history of one pack per day
times 65 years.  He currently has a past medical history of
emphysema.  A chest x-ray in [**3-/2194**] showed a small lung
nodule.  Follow-up CT scan showed a lingular mass which
appeared to be lung cancer.  He was admitted to hospital on
[**2194-10-6**] for a limited thoracotomy and lingular wedge
resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Arthritis.
2.  Peptic ulcer disease.
3.  Duodenal ulcers.
4.  Coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction in [**2170**].
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No significant past surgical history.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Nortriptyline.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13783**] is a retired auto salesman who
has a 90-pack-year smoking history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination Mr. [**Known lastname 13783**] appeared
well.  He had no palpable lymph nodes on head and neck exam.
He had some clubbing of his fingers noticed.  His lungs were
clear to auscultation.  He had regular heart rate and normal
heart sounds.  His abdominal exam was benign.  His abdomen
was soft and nontender to palpation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2194-10-6**] Mr. [**Known lastname 13783**] was admitted to
the hospital for limited thoracotomy and lingular wedge
resection.  He was placed under general anesthesia and
intubated.  He tolerated the procedure well with no
complications and awoke in the Recovery Room.  In the OR
because of respiratory distress he was bronchoscoped and
successfully extubated in the Recovery Room.  The epidural
was replaced, as well in the Recovery Room due to
insufficient pain analgesia.  The estimated blood loss of the
surgery was 220 cc.

Postoperatively a chest tube was placed on the left side.
Postoperatively he was afebrile with stable vital signs and
had an epidural for pain analgesia.  He had clear lung fields
and a regular heart rate.  His abdomen was benign, and his
extremities were warm with no edema.

His course in hospital was uneventful.  On postoperative day
one he remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  He
remained on the epidural with the chest tube in place.

On [**2194-10-8**], postoperative day two, he continued to do
well.  He remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
chest tube developed a small leak.  The chest tube was
subsequently removed.  The epidural was also removed, as well
as the Foley on this day.  The patient tolerated everything
well and voided after the Foley was removed.

Mr. [**Known lastname 13783**] has been ambulating well independently.  He has
voided since the removal of the Foley and has been tolerating
p.o. intake well.  His pain has been well controlled on oral
medications.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy in the hospital and
deemed independent in his activity.  However, it was
suggested that he would benefit from a few sessions of
physical therapy prior to discharge.

The patient is currently stable for discharge home and has
been advised to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 14732**] office to arrange a follow-
up appointment in one week.  He has also been advised that
the outer dressing can be removed two days after discharge
and that he may shower.  He has also been advised not to
drive a vehicle until off pain medications and he has been
seen in the [**Hospital 702**] clinic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Albuterol sulfate 0.083% solution one to three puffs q. 6
hours p.r.n.
2.  Percocet 5/325 3 mg tabs, one to two tablets p.o. q. 4 h.
p.r.n.
3.  Colace 100 mg capsules, one capsule p.o. twice a day.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Lung cancer.

Service:  MEDICINE

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Lung tumor.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Lung tumor.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Left upper lobe limited resection via
a thoracotomy and biopsy of left lower lobe.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old man
with a history of chronic cough, dyspnea on exertion, status
post old MI, history of interstitial lung disease who
presented with a mass in the medial aspect of the left lower
lobe.  The patient had a PET scan which was positive in this
region as well as a clarifying CAT scan.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the OR for the procedure
above.  He did well immediately perioperatively from this
procedure and was getting ready to be discharge home on
postoperative day number two; however, he had low saturations
and dyspnea on the evening of postoperative day number two
and had to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  From
this point on, he spent approximately ten days in the
Cardiothoracic Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he started
to become progressively more hypoxic, eventually requiring
intubation.

He had a picture that blossomed into ARDS and after various
modes of ventilatory therapy, including antibiotics and
pulmonary toilet, he was noted not to be progressing in the
ARDS.  He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
Service on postoperative day number ten and continued to
undergo various modes of ventilatory weaning.

Eventually, despite multiple modes of therapy and the
inability to make progress on his ARDS with a worsening PF
ratio, family discussions with the service were had and the
patient was made DNR comfort care only.  He expired on
[**2194-11-8**] with no autopsy allegedly performed.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:   Left-sided lung tumor.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:   Limited thoracotomy with biopsy of the
above with multisystem organ failure and Adult Respiratory
Distress Syndrome occurring postoperatively.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-9-17**] 7:13 PM
IMPRESSION: Small right pneumothorax

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-9-19**] 11:37 AM
1) Interval placement of a right subclavian venous catheter in
good position.
2) Stable size of the right apical pneumothorax.
3) Stable atelectasis at the left base.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-9-21**] 10:20 AM
Comparison is made to prior study 2 days ago. Right apical
pneumothorax looks slightly smaller. Basilar density is
essentially unchanged. This may represent consolidation,
atelectasis and/or effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14731**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service at
[**Hospital1 18**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 14732**] care on [**2182-9-17**].  On that day he
underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsies, fiberoptic
bronchoscopy and right lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph
node dissection.  For details of the operation, see procedure
note.  Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural line placed
and a foley catheter and 2 chest tubes placed intraoperatively.
His primary issue in the immediate post-op period was pressure
support for which he was placed on a neosynephrine drip-stopped
prior to going to the floor.  Due to his BP issues, his epidural
was removed on POD#1 and a PCA was installed for pain control.

On POD#2, the patient went into atrial fibrillation and was
treated with 2g of IV magnesium sulfate, fluid boluses, 150cc
amiodarone bolus x2, calcium chloride, diltiazem and was then
moved to the critical care unit for BP monitoring.  At that time
he was started on a diltiazem drip.

On POD#3, patient's hematocrit was noted to be 26.8; however, a
repeat hematocrit was 29.3 and it was decided not to transfuse
the patient with blood products. Also, the patient was moved to
the floor after being deemed stable enough on the diltiazem drip
that same day.

On POD#4, the chest tubes and foley catheter were removed.
Also, the patient was started on a Heparin drip and coumadin 5mg
QHS for anticoagulation secondary to the atrial fibrillation.
EPS was consulted at that time and recommended maintaining
amiodarone at 800mg/day for 1 week, 400 mg/day 2 weeks
thereafter and finally 200mg/day to finish.  Also, the diltiazem
drip was subsequently discontinued that day.  They also
requested the patient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in
Cardiology/[**Hospital **] Clinic in 6 weeks and to continue on coumadin
until then.

On POD#7, patient became therapeutic on his coumadin with an INR
of 2.3.  He was seen by physical therapy who had recommended he
be placed in a rehabilitation facility for further conditioning
the previous day.  He was finally discharged on POD#8, [**2182-9-25**],
in good condition, tolerating a house diet and ambulating with
assistance.  He is asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in [**12-7**]
weeks and to call for an appointment.  He must also continue
having his PTT/INR checked on a daily basis for conitnued
coumadin dosing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to OMED from the ED.  Pt was started on bactrim
in addition to his ceftriaxone and azithromycin, as it was felt
that his recent steroid taper might have predisposed him to PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were started for COPD
relief, however steroids were initially held given possible
immunosuppressed state (recent steroids, possible PCP).  On the
day following admission, in the AM pt looked better less
respiratory distress and tachypnea.  However, as the day
progressed, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly dyspneic and
experienced desaturations into the mid-low 80's, and the patient
was admitted to the ICU where his nebs were continued, steroids
added on (inhaled and systemic, the latter for a 2-week course),
and antibiotics changed to ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and
vancomycin given possible postobstructive pneumonia with sputum
cx growing out coag + staphylococci.  Pt stabilized in the ICU
and was called out to the floor where he remained tachypneic but
appeared less symptomatic, with main complaint being copious
sputum production that was difficult to clear.  The results came
back from the sputum cx, showing pcn-resistance, so vancomycin
was continued.  Final culture results revealed MRSA and no PCP;
vancomycin was continued, and pt was placed on MRSA precautions.
 For sputum, started aggressive chest PT, guaifenisen, and
mucomyst.  Pt continued to require 5L O2 by nasal cannula, but
appeared clinically improved from a respiratory standpoint.
Aggressive chest PT was pursued, which also helped, per report
of pt.  A PICC was placed in anticipation of pt's dispo to a
pulmonary rehabilitation facility to finish vancomycin course.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left lower lobe lung mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 74-year-old
male status post bilateral nephrectomy for renal cell
carcinoma who had a suspicious mass in the left lower lobe on
a follow-up chest x-ray for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
He was admitted for wedge resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, end stage renal disease secondary to
bilateral nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, coronary
artery disease status post CABG times three,
hypercholesterolemia, pacemaker.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Captopril 50 mg tid, enteric
coated Aspirin one q d, Glyburide 2.5 mg q d, Lipitor,
Prilosec, Nephrocaps, Coreg, Ativan 2 mg daily, Benadryl 800
mg [**Hospital1 **], TUMS tid.

ALLERGIES:  IV contrast and Morphine.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an elective left
thoracoscopy, limited left thoracotomy and wedge resection
left lower lobe.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the ICU for postoperative management.  Renal consult
was obtained for his renal issues.  Electrophysiology consult
was also obtained because he was pacing at 40 beats per
minute postoperatively.  They interrogated the pacer and
reset it.  He was stable in the ICU though he needed to
remain on Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain his blood pressure.
On postoperative day #2 he was off the Neo-Synephrine and
stable enough for transfer to a regular floor.  He did
remarkably well on regular floor, his analgesics and po pain
medication and he was deemed ready for discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  All the same as preoperative
medications with the addition of Percocet 1-2 tablets po q
4-6 hours prn.

FOLLOW-UP:  With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in one week.

History of Present Illness:
Pt had a radio-frequency tumor ablation of left lung for new LLL
small cell lung cancer, as he was an extremely poor surgical
risk.  A small PTX was noted in the left lung after the
procedure and a pigtail catheter was placed.  A RUL collapse was
also noted thought to be secondary to mucus plugging or
aspiration.  A CXR showed a new lower lobe infilitrate and small
effusion on right.  The Pt dropped his pressure soon after the
procedure and was given 1L of LR and placed on norepinephrine.
MICU was then consulted.
.
Upon arrival the patient was noted to still be intubated and
ventilated from the procedure with a RR=14 and Vt=700.  An ABG
taken at that time was 7.14/73/187.  Labs were as follows:
WBC=12.8, Hct=30.6, Plts=248, PTT=43.8, INR=1.4, Na=140, K=4.8,
Cl-104, CO2=23, BUN=27, Cr=1.2, GLUC=292, MG=2.0, Ca=8.9,
lactate=6.7, albumin=2.8, troponin=0.02.  The Pts respiratory
rate was increased to 22 and 2L of LR was run wide-open with the
result of his ABG= 7.31/37/317.  However, his BP continued to
drop despite maximal dose of norepinephrine and continual IVF.
Given bedside TEE findings that showed a decreased CO and a
mixed venous O2 in the high 50s, a cardiogenic component to his
shock was entertained and dobutamine was added.  This resulted
in transient increase in BP, but it then dropped markedly to
SBPs=40s and epinephrine 1 mg had to be pushed and an
epinephrine gtt was started.  The Pts BP responded well to the
epinephrine, but continual epinephrine boluses had to be
administered to maintain MAPs = 60s.  Thus vasopressin was
added.  A swan was floated and showed his PAP and wedge pressure
to be wnl.  A follow-up Hct was 23, thus 2 units of PRBCs were
given and Hct bumped to 29.  Given the Pts documented adrenal
insufficiency, he was administered 4 mg dexamethasone
empirically.  A follow-up CXR showed the evolution of a large
left sided pleural effusion.
.
Upon being transferred to the MICU the Pt had been given 10.5 L
of LR and was on norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine and
vasopressin.  After coming to the MICU the Pt was able to be
weaned off norepinephrine and dobutamine, maintaining his
MAP=70s.  He received an additional 3L of LR.  Two additional
chest tubes were placed that drained 1.5L of blood out of the
left pleural space.

projects over the floor of the right ventricle. No definite
pneumothorax is present. A large bulla in the right middle lobe
displaces the anterior junction to the left.
.
Bilateral Upper Extremity Ultrasound
RIGHT SIDE. Jugular vein and subclavian vein are widely patent.
They demonstrate normal compressibility and augmentation were
appropriate and normal respiratory phasicity.
There is an acute thrombus involving the right axillary vein and
extending distally to the level of the brachial vein. This
thrombus is relatively anechoic and is producing expansion of
the vessel. The right basilic and cephalic vessels appear
patent.
LEFT SIDE: There is normal compressibility, augmentation, and
respiratory variation in the deep vessels of the left upper
extremity were appropriate. The PICC line is identified in good
position.
.
EKG:  normal sinus rhythm @ 83 bpm, normal PR/QRS/QT intervals,
normal T waves, no ST segment elevations or depressions.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respitory Status:  Patient developed a small right
pneumothorax and large left hemothorax after IR radio-ablation
procedure for a NSCLC mass in the left lower lobe.  Because of
the hemothorax he had 3 chest tubes placed on the left side by
thoracic surgery.  These drained well after placement and were
removed as the output decreased.  The last chest tube was
removed on the day of discharge.  He had been intubated during
the procedure and remained so on transfer to the MICU.  On
hospital day 3 his sputum grew out MRSA and he was treated with
vancomycin for a 7 day course.  His respiratory status on the
vent waxed and waned and after fluid resuscitation for
hypotension was noted to have significant pulmonary edema.  He
required diuresis later in hospital stay which help to improve
his respiratory status.  After his course of vanco he continued
to spike fevers and then sputum from [**12-13**] grew out Klebsiella
that was sensitive to meropenem/gent/imipenem/pip-tazo.  He was
started on meropenem with plans for 15 day course.  Meropenem
will need to be continued until [**2127-12-31**].  Since the meropenem
was started his sputum samples have been contaminated so no new
data is available.  His fevers have drifted down, but continues
to have low grade fevers at times which is felt to be secondary
to his cancer.  He had a trach and PEG tube placed on [**12-16**].
After his trach procedure it was noted that the trach was
abutted against the posterior wall.  A bronch was performed the
day after trach and was noted to collapse when patient was
placed on 0/0 vent support.  The trach was then advanced forward
2 cm.  After this he continued to have some difficulties with
the trach so we attempted to deflate the cuff on the trach and
allow patient to breath through both trach and mouth.  He
tolerated this well going 10 hours a day on trach mask.  At
night he was placed on CPAP/PS 8/5 FiO2 40% for rest.  He will
need further weaning at rehab.  When patient on trach mask his
cuff must be deflated in his trach.
.
2. Fever
Pt was persistently febrile throughout his stay.  He has MRSA
and Klebsiella pna and C. diff. colitis as noted.  His fever did
not change with antibiotic therapy.  Etilogy felt most likely
[**3-5**] cancer; other etiology included residual hemothorax v.
empyema, however these were considered less likely given the
patient continued to improve.  He had serial blood and urine
cultures, all of which were negative.  All catheter tip cultures
were also negative.
.
3. CAD - s/p LAD stents ~3wk pta
On asa, plavix, bb, gemofibrozil; added ACE-I and titrated to
lisinopril 10mg.  No evidence of ischemia throughotu his stay.
.
4. Afib w/ RVR
Initially complicated by hypotension.  Was loaded with IV and PO
amiodarone (400mg [**Hospital1 **] x7d, then 400mg qd x7d), completed [**12-23**].
Beta-blocker titrated and has had stable HR and BP over last
week.  Initially not on anticoagulation given hemothorax.
However started heparin ~1 week ago and coumadin [**12-23**]. Goal PTT
50-70, goal INR [**3-6**].
Has PM for SSS.
.
5. Seizure disorder
On dilantin, required several IV loads.  Has had stable
therapeutic levels on current dose of 300mg tid.
.
6. NSCLC
Found on biopsy of left lower lung lesion.  Underwent RF
ablation given he was a poor surgical candidate.  Further
treatment options unclear at this point.  If his condition
improves, this will need to be re-addressed.
.
7. Adrenal insufficiency
Currently on prednisone at home dose of 20mg.  Per d/w PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
has been on variable doses of 5-20mg but has not tolerated
discontinuation entirely.  His dose was not weened during his
ICU stay.
.
8. C.diff- Patient found to be cdiff positive on [**12-13**].  Started
on flagyl.  Plan to continue for 10 days after meropenem is
finished.
.
9. Right [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 91691**] Pt found tohave right basilic-axillary clot on
ultrasound.  Started on heparin with goal PTT 50-70.  Coumadin
started [**12-23**].  Goal INR [**3-6**].  Will need to stop heparin 2 days
after INR is therapeutic.
.
11. Thrush- Started on 7 day course of fluconazole for thrush
that was not resopnsive to nystatin.  Continue till [**12-29**].
.
11. Access - Left double lumen PICC placed [**12-15**].

Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure s/p airway fire

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy
bronchoscopy
placement of arterial line
placement of right IJ central venous line

History of Present Illness:
67yo woman with h/o tobacco use, breast CA, who presented to [**Hospital 2586**] Hosp on [**2160-4-22**] with dyspnea, cough and
blood-streaked sputum x 4d, found to have R main stem bronchus
(RMSB) near obstruction, underwent laser resection [**4-24**]
complicated by intraoperative airway fire and extensive
endobronchial burn, now in resp failure s/p trach, transferred
for trach revision and second opinion.
.
Patient's CT scan at OSH showed a near obstructing RUL lung
mass, which on subsequent biopsy turned out to be a squamous
cell CA. She also had a breast biopsy recently which returned as
infiltrating ductal CA. On [**4-24**], she underwent a laser resection
of her lung mass in a palliative attempt to open up her RLL, RML
and RUL. They were able to open her RLL and RML, though upon
trying to open the RUL and while at 22% oxygen concentration an
airway fire occurred. The IP MD put his mouth on the ETT and
blew out the fire, though it lasted [**6-28**] secs in his opinion. She
suffered an extensive endobronchial burn injury. Subsequent to
that, she developed a large R pleural effusion, underwent
CT-guided drainage with pigtail cath placement, which itself was
complicated by a tension PTX, leading to eventual chest tube
placement. She was later felt to have a L PTX from barotrauma,
and underwent a L chest tube placement. A tracheostomy was
performed.
.
On [**5-8**], on a repeat bronch, it was noted that the patient had
narrowing of the R main stem bronchus again, severely limiting
her airflow. They dilated the RMSB and placed an uncovered 8mm x
30mm metal stent in the RMSB, expecting to occlude the RUL but
maintain the patency of the RLL and RML. Subsequent bronch
showed tumor starting to grow in the distal trachea, distorting
the opening of the R main bronchus.  She then underwent [**2-23**]
treatments to this area with external beam XRT. Despite this,
her resp status worsened, with increasing tachypnea and air
hunger, which they felt was from near obstruction of the distal
trachea as visualized by another bronch.

A meeting was held with the patient's friend [**Name (NI) 27272**] [**Name (NI) **], who
felt that the pt would not want further measures taken, and so
the patient was made DNR/DNI. However, the patient's previously
estranged daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 27273**] was [**Name (NI) 653**], and she stated that
she wanted the patient to continue to receive maximal care
except for electric shocks and CPR.  Furthermore, she wanted the
pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion and possible
therapeutic measures.  As [**Doctor First Name 27272**] was not officially the HCP, and
the daughter the next-of-[**Doctor First Name **], the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] is the accepting physician.

Past Medical History:
1. Single episode of seizure of unclear etiology 20 years ago
with negative workup.
2. Supraventricular tachycardia.
3. Depression.
4. Arthritis.
5. Breast CA
6. Lung CA

Social History:
The patient smoked one to two packs a day for more than 40 years
(100+ packyears), quit [**2-25**].  No history of alcohol.  Lives with
friend of five years, [**Name (NI) 27272**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27274**], who by the
pt's will should be the pt's HCP, though no HCP form was signed
by patient. Patient's daughter (previously estranged), [**Name (NI) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
67yo woman with lung CA, extensive endobronchial burn from
airway fire with resultant resp failure, admitted for rigid
bronchoscopy.  During her hospitalization the following issues
were addressed:
.
#Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:  This was felt
to be due to combination of lung injury from smoke inhalation
with capillary leak, bilateral pneumonia, volume overload and
airway disease secondary to lobar collapse with lung cancer.
She underwent rigid bronchoscopy in the OR [**2160-6-4**] with
debridement of eschar, removal of RMS stent in pieces and
replacement of tracheostomy. Extensive pseudomembranes were seen
mid-trachea down to distal LLL. Lingula was obstructed with
pseudomembranes.  She required pressure control ventilation with
maximum pressure and oxygenation support.  Repeat bronchoscopy
[**2160-6-4**] showed diffuse eschar with with sluffing mucosa, lingula
obstructed by pseudomembrane, no bleeding.  She was diuresed as
blood pressure tolerated, but by day three became hypotensive
requiring pressor support.  LENIs were performed to evaluate for
PE and were negative.  She was too unstable to go to the CT
scanner as she desaturated on FiO2 of 80% with any movement.
She was treated with vancomycin, cefepime for pneumonia.  This
was changed to vancomycin and meropenem on day three.  She
underwent a third bronchoscopy [**2160-6-5**].  An esophageal balloon
was placed [**2160-6-6**] which showed exp transpulmonary pressure 2,
insp transpulmonary pressure 15, exp intrathoracic pressure 16,
insp intrathoracic pressure 19, exp total pressure 18, insp
total pressure 34.  She continued ot be difficult to oxygenate,
and required sedation and paralysis to maintain respiratory
support.  She underwent two further bronchoscopies [**2160-6-7**].
.
#Hypotension: Thought to be pre-sepsis/SIRS.  Blood pressure was
supported with normal saline iv fluid boluses and levophed.
Cortisol stimulation test was negative indicating no adrenal
insufficiency.
.
#Sedation:  Patient was transfered from OSH intubated, sedated,
paralyzed; on Fentanyl drip, 300mcg/hr; Versed drip, 22mg/hr;
Nimbex drip, 4.2mcg/kg/min.  Nibmex was changed to vecuronium as
nibmex was maxed and she was still responding.  She  was weaned
off vecuronium twice, but both times responded with hypoxemia,
PaO2 50s.  When the decision was made to withdraw ventilatory
support, the vecuronium was discontintued five hours prior to
ventilatory weaning.
.
#Elevated wbc/fever: Patient was noted to have bilateral
infilatrates on chest x-ray and urinalysis consistent with
infection.  Sputum and BAL cultures grew pseudomonas.
Additionally there was a report of stenotrophomonus infection at
the OSH that was not seen on BAL or sputum culture at [**Hospital1 18**].
She was treated initially with cefepime and vancomycin.
Cefepime was switched to meropenem to broaden gram-negative
coverage.
.
#CV
a) Supraventricular tachycardia ofunclear etiology, though
longstanding per the notes (was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2152**] for
this problem). Started amiodarone at osh on [**2160-6-1**] in response
to SVT with HR in 160s. She was continued on Digoxin 0.125 qday,
and amiodarone was change to po dosing.  She was in rapid afib
[**2160-6-6**], but otherwise remained in sinus, sinus tachycardia.
b) Coronaries: no h/o CAD
c) Pump: no prior history of CHF. volume overloaded with
continued urine output.
.
#DM: patient was kept on insulin gtt for tight glucose control.
.
# Anemia: stools were guiaic negative.  anemia was thought to be
due to chronic inflammation.
.
#Buttocks: Decubitus ulcer was treated with accuzyme and dressed
daily
.
#FEN: patient continued ot have high residuals while on
paralytics.  She received tubefeeds.  electrolytes were repleted
as needed.
.
#Code status:  the patient expired [**2160-6-8**] after family meeting
was held and decision made to withdraw care with focus on
comfort measures.  The patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 27273**], was
present.  The patient's son had visited the day prior.

signs are stable.  96% on room air.  Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm
with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended with normal bowel sounds.  Well healed scars
both midline and lower abdomen.  Extremities were warm and
well perfuse with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
where a right upper lobe and middle lobe resection was
performed.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively and she did well.  The patient was
extubated and continued to do well.  She was transferred to
the floor where she continued to improve.  Her diet was
advanced.  Her Foley was removed.  The patient was seen by
physical therapy, which continued to work with her.  She had
difficulty clearing secretions and was often unable to do
deep breathing, which required a lot of motivation, however,
the patient continued to improve and slowly started to begin
ambulating.  The patient was seen also by medicine for
hypertension and was started on Amiodarone.  The patient
continued to improve and on [**2197-7-18**] is discharged home in
stable condition with plans to have home physical therapy to
continue aggressive pulmonary toilet and to improve
ambulation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Vicodin for pain.  Lopressor 25
b.i.d., Combivent, Albuterol, Amiodarone 400 mg q.d.,

Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
woman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
and asthma, who developed a vague cough and some right-sided
chest discomfort about a year ago.  A chest CT showed a 4.6 x
4.4 cm mass in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
It was noted to abut the esophagus and invade the right
paraspinal area.  There were 1 cm pretracheal nodes.  On
[**2112-12-16**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy that
demonstrated chronic inflammation with focal epithelial
atypia.  On [**2113-2-8**], the patient underwent a PET scan that
showed increased activity in the right upper lobe mass, the
right hilar lymph node, and some moderately increased uptake
in the pretracheal lymph nodes.  On [**2113-2-16**], the patient
underwent a diagnostic mediastinoscopy.  All 35 nodes were
negative.  On [**2113-3-10**], the patient underwent a thorascopic
evaluation with biopsy of the right hilar lymph node.
Pathology demonstrated non-small cell lung cancer with
squamous differentiation.  At the time of surgery, the right
upper lobe was found to invade along the broad surface into
the vertebral column.  It was decided that the patient would
be best served by receiving preoperative chemo-radiation.  At
this point, she had experienced a 7 pound weight loss over 3
months and her appetite has been a little lower than usual.
She denied shortness of breath but did have some dyspnea on
exertion after walking up one flight of stairs.

A restaging set of PET and CT scans showed significant
decrease in activity within the right upper lobe mass and
hilar lymph nodes as well as significant reduction in the
overall size on CT scan.  There was, however, an area of bony
erosion where the tumor abuts the vertebral column.  MRI
showed a more extensive involvement of the vertebral body.
It was decided to have Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] of neurosurgery to
participate in the resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Tenormin 100 mg p.o. q.day.
Diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient is a well-
developed elderly female who is active.
Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 120/74, pulse 66, temperature
97.1, weight 149, oxygen saturation 97 percent on room air.
HEENT;  Sclerae anicteric.  Pupils equal, round and reactive.

equal.  Thorax is symmetrical without masses.
Heart:  Regular without murmur.
Abdomen:  Benign.
Extremities:  No clubbing or edema.
Neurologic:  Grossly nonfocal with an intact and appropriate
mental status.
Skin:  No lesions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2113-6-16**], the patient underwent a right
thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy, radical mediastinal
lymph node dissection and an intercostal muscle flap to the
bronchial stump.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] of neurosurgery performed
a partial body resection of T4 and T5.  At the time of
surgery, the margins were clear.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Please see dictated Operative Notes for
further details.  The patient was kept intubated overnight
and was extubated the following morning without incident.
Over the following three days, the patient experienced some
post-op oliguria which resolved with several fluid boluses.
Lasix was then begun for diuresis.  On post-op day two, the
patient was noted to need aggressive chest PT which she did
receive.  On post-op day three, the patient's hematocrit had
dropped to 27.2 and she received a unit of packed red blood
cells.  This brought her hematocrit up to 32.5.

The patient also underwent a speech and swallowing evaluation
which she failed.  Therefore, a feeding tube was placed and
her tube feeds were slowly advanced to goal.

Post-op day four was the first day the patient experienced a
negative fluid balance.  This continued through most of her
hospital stay.  On post-op day five, the patient continued to
do well and was transferred to the floor.  On post-op day
six, the patient was found to be in sinus tachycardia with
wheezing and a chest x-ray showed collapse of the right upper
and right lower lobes.  The patient was, therefore,
transferred to the ICU.  Over the course of the following
day, the patient underwent two bronchoscopies with suction of
copious amounts of fluid.  On post-op day seven, the patient
was noted to have methemoglobinemia, presumably secondary to
benzocaine use.  The patient was treated with methylene blue
and improved.

On post-op day eight, a sputum showed gram-negative rods and
the patient was started on levofloxacin.  This antibiotic was
continued until post-op day 14.  Also on that day, a post-
pyloric feeding tube was placed.  The chest x-ray was noted
to be worse on this day and chest PT continued.  On post-op
day 11, the patient experienced right arm swelling.  The
patient underwent a right  upper extremity ultrasound which
showed a right cephalic and right internal jugular deep vein
thrombosis.  The patient was begun on a heparin drip and
eventually transitioned to Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 - 3.
The most appropriate Coumadin dose seemed to be 2.5 mg q.day.
Also on post-op day 11, the chest x-ray was noted to be
slightly improved.  On post-op 12, a PICC was obtained for
I.V. access.

The patient also underwent a re-evaluation of her swallowing
function and was found to tolerate thin liquids.  The post-
pyloric feeding tube was, therefore, removed.  On post-op day
14, the patient continued to do well but a chest x-ray showed
a possible right lung collapse.  A bronchoscopy revealed a
large amount of mucopurulent secretions in the right middle
and lower lobes.  The patient was continued on PT and
diuresis.  On post-op day 17, the patient was transfused for
a hematocrit of 24.6, which brought her up to a hematocrit of
33.9.  By post-op day 19, the patient was therapeutic on
Coumadin and chest x-ray showed improved aeration of the
right middle and lower lobes.  She had experienced no
desaturation episodes over the preceding several days.  She
looked well and was discharged to rehab on Coumadin with
aggressive chest PT.

DISPOSITION:  To rehab facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  In addition to the admitting diagnoses
listed above in the past medical history, the patient has
adenocarcinoma of her right upper lobe, status post right
upper lobectomy, and metastatic carcinoma to her vertebral
soft tissue.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Warfarin 2.5 mg p.o. q.day.
Ipratropium nebs.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diagnosed this admission, who was
transferred for [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2120-8-8**].

She had a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes
mellitus, asthma, and diastolic congestive heart failure.
She initially presented to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital on
[**8-1**] with worsening shortness of breath, weight gain, and
peripheral edema, which had progressed over weeks.  A
subsequent workup revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, with
mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.  She was noted to
have a left-sided pleural effusion as well as an adrenal
mass.  LDH was markedly evaluated at 729.  CA125 was also
markedly elevated at 1634.  A transvaginal ultrasound
demonstrated an abnormal-appearing right adnexal structure.
A diagnosed thoracentesis was also performed which showed an
exudate with abundant large atypical lymphocytes; suspicious
for lymphoma.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 17 years,
complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy.
2.  Coronary artery disease; status post multiple cardiac
catheterizations showing severe 2-vessel coronary artery

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was single and worked as a hair
dresser.  She owned her own salon.  No history of tobacco or
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history significant for coronary
artery disease and diabetes in her mother and father.  There
was no family history of cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed an obese, Caucasian female, in moderate
respiratory distress, temperature was 99, blood pressure
was 140/80, pulse was 78, respiratory rate was 26, SpO2
was 97% on 4 liters, weight was 101.8 kg.  Skin was
anicteric.  No rash.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed extraocular movements were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  No oral lesions were noted.  The neck was supple,
obese.  Lungs revealed absent breath sounds at the bases with
dullness to percussion.  Heart sounds were distant, a 2/6
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.  The
abdomen was obese, soft, and nontender.  Extremities revealed
1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission showed a white blood cell count of 16.6, hematocrit
was 26.2, platelets were 575, mean cell volume was 81, RDW
was 15.4.  Differential revealed 86% neutrophils.  PT
was 12.9, INR was 1.2, PTT was 26.4.  Sodium was 140,
potassium was 4.5, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 26, blood
urea nitrogen was 94, creatinine was 2.2, blood glucose
was 45.  Magnesium was 2.5, calcium was 9.8.  ALT was 22, AST
was 33, alkaline phosphatase was 79, amylase was 89, lipase
was 75, total bilirubin was 0.2, albumin was 3.6.  Urinalysis
showed 2 hyaline casts with some granular casts.  LDH at
[**Hospital 26200**] Hospital measured 729, CA125 was 1639,
C-reactive protein was greater than 25, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate was 110, CEA was 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further oncologic workup and
treatment.  The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, revealing
extrinsic compression of the left lower lobe bronchus.

A biopsy was obtained of the subcarinal nodes, which revealed
B cell lymphoma.  The patient was noted to have melena and
hematemesis.  An endoscopy was pursued, which showed
extremely friable mucosa, suggesting possible involvement of
the gastrointestinal mucosa.

She was seen by Oncology Service and initiated on CHOP.  This
was complicated by tumor lysis and urate nephropathy.  She
developed progressive shortness of breath with hypoxia while
on the medical floor, and ultimately required intubation on
[**8-15**] for worsening hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis;
necessitating transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

She underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage which showed mucopurulent secretions in the left lower
lobe with cultures positive for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Chest imaging revealed multifocal
pneumonia in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, as
well as compressive atelectasis versus consolidation in both
lower lobes and lingula.  There were large bilateral pleural
effusions.  She was treated with antibiotics including
ceftazidime and vancomycin.  A left-sided thoracentesis was
performed which showed an exudative process.  Her urate
nephropathy improved over time.  She continued to mount
fevers and required ventilatory support despite continued
antibiotic treatment and diuresis; likely as a result of her
inability to clear her pneumonia and lymphomatous involvement
of the lungs.

Given her poor prognosis, the patient's family decided to
withdraw support which was compatible with the patient's
previously stated wishes.  The patient was extubated on
[**9-5**] and died the following morning (on [**9-6**]) at
11:25 a.m.

DEATH/DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, large B cell type.
2.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.

Chief Complaint:
left lower lobe lung cancer recurrance

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p completion VATS Left lower Lobectomy for staple line
recurrence [**2142-7-23**]
Left upper lobe wedge resection for tear, flexible bronchoscopy.
Redo left thoracotomy with completion left lower lobectomy,
Pedicle intercostal muscle flap, Mediastinal lymph nodal
dissection.


History of Present Illness:
54-year-old woman who underwent radiation in [**2123**] for Hodgkin
lymphoma. She subsequently developed 1.5 cm adenocarcinoma of
left lower lobe which was treated with a left thoracotomy and
wedge excision by my partner, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**], on [**2140-11-15**]. A wedge excision rather than a lobectomy was
performed due to the fibrosis of the hilum associated with
the prior mediastinal radiation. Routine followup imaging for
both her lung cancer and her lymphoma demonstrated new 1.5-cm
nodule along the staple line which is FDG-avid. This was felt
to be most consistent with a recurrent lung cancer along the
staple line. She underwent preoperative evaluation, including
pulmonary function tests, which demonstrated reasonable lung
function. I also discussed her case with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**]
of pulmonology, who has followed her for some time. Both of
us thought she could tolerate a completion left lower
lobectomy. She does have some baseline dyspnea, and our
concern was that we would worsen this with completion left
lower lobectomy. However, due to the location of the tumor
and the recurrent nature, we felt completion left lower
lobectomy was the best treatment and that it was unlikely
that we would worsen her dyspnea.

Past Medical History:
Hodgjin's disease with radiation, HCV, CHF, cholecystectomy,
splenectomy, kidney stones, endometriosis, s/p BMT, carpal
tunnel syndrome, hypothyroidism

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-7-29**] 7:05 AM
Reason: ? improvement
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old woman s/p left lower lobectomy s/p CT removal
HISTORY: Status post left lower lobectomy, chest tube removal,
question improvement.
There is increased lucency at the left lung apex. I suspect the
presence of a small pneumothorax, though this appearance is
difficult to distinguish definitively due to overlying clavicle
and possible bullous changes as well as pleural thickening.
Appearance is similar to that on the film from [**2142-7-27**]. Pleural
thickening along the left chest wall and left costophrenic angle
is unchanged compared with one day earlier. The degree of
increased retrocardiac opacity with interstitial markings
including right perihilar increased interstitial markings is
unchanged. No right effusion is identified. Right subclavian
central line again noted, tip over distal SVC. Known left-sided
rib fracture less well visualized on today's examination.

IMPRESSION: Without significant change compared with one day
earlier. Focal lucency in left apex - - question artifact versus
small stable pneumothorax. Small-to-moderate sized left pleural
effusion is unchanged. A small degree of left mediastinal shift
is unchanged. Increased interstitial markings - - question CHF,
are also stable.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Unsteady gait, worsening mental status, and fatigue.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] speaks very little English, and an interpreter was
unable to be obtained, therefore the details of the HPI have
been obtained from the neurology note of earlier tonight. Mr
[**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old man with stage IIIA non-small cell lung
cancer metastatic to the brain, as well as prior stroke, who
presents with progressive fatigue, depression, and about 1 week
of unsteady gait. His cancer has been treated with seven weeks
of weekly carboplatin/Taxol with radiation followed by resection
[**2147-3-28**]. He underwent Cyberknife [**2148-3-14**] for his brain
metastasis, and subsequently had resection of radiation necrosis
on [**2148-7-12**].

He was referred to the ED by his visiting nurse and his wife,
who report progressively worsening gait with multiple falls over
the last week. He has additionally had incontinence, thought
secondary to inability to get to the bathroom in time. He has
also noted some increased weakness of the right arm and right
leg, along with some episodes of right arm jerking at night with
left arm extension. Of note, his decadron was decrased from 4 mg
daily to 2 mg daily last week.

On arrival to the ED, his vital signs were temperature 96.8 F,
heart rate 81, blood pressure 134/77, respiratory rate 16, and
oxygen saturation at 98% on room air. He had a head CT that did
not demonstrate any change from prior.  Neurology was consulted
and recommended a head MRI which he was unable to get secondary
to inability to answer questions about his medical history.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He was initially presented with progressive
cough; found to have a spiculated nodule on CXR. Non-small cell
lung cancer, stage IIIA, diagnosed in [**2-17**]. Pathology
demonstrated metastatic carcinoma in [**7-17**] lymph nodes. He
underwent weekly carboplatin and Taxol chemotherapy with
radiation therapy for seven weeks followed by surgery on
[**2147-3-28**]. He developed brain metastases and had Cyberknife
radiosurgery to a left medial frontal metastasis
on [**2148-3-14**] to 1,800 cGy, and then resection of radiation
necrosis by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. on [**2148-7-12**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
(1) Coronary Artery Disease: He is status post ST elevation MI
in [**11-15**] with stent to the left circumflex artery at the [**Hospital1 3343**].

regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis (EF 50-55%).
(3) Stroke: Small CVAs noted on head CT at [**Hospital1 1774**] in [**11-15**]
(4) Deep Venous Thrombosis: This was diagnosed shortly after his
hospitalization for MI; he is on Coumadin.
(5) Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: He was diagnosed during
admission for MI. He had a negative bubble echo after old small
CVA's noted on head MRI.

Service:  Thoracic Surgery


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66-year-old gentleman,
status post multiple lung resections for tumor. On [**2151-6-29**], the patient underwent a mediastinoscopy and therapeutic
bronchoscopy and was found to have this large right upper
lobe mass abutting the mediastinum and right main pulmonary
artery. Biopsy proved this to be a mixed tumor, mostly small
lung cell cancer, however, some features of small cell lung
cancer. He had had a failed attempt with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy and had decided to proceed with a resection.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Known coronary artery disease.
2. Known lung cancer.
3. Peptic ulcer disease.
4. Home oxygen requirement.


MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Advair.
2. Combivent.
3. Ativan.
4. Prevacid.
5. Effexor.
6. Ambien.


BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2151-6-29**], the patient
underwent a purportedly uneventful right upper and middle
lobectomy without complication. He was kept intubated
overnight in the PACU and sedated, planned for extubation in
the morning.

By the afternoon of postoperative day #1, the patient had
been extubated, however, had a persistent inotrope support
requirement. He was changed to ICU status and transferred to
the intensive care unit.

By postoperative day #3, the patient was comfortable,
however, remained extremely disoriented. There was some
question of whether his disorientation was secondary to
alcoholic withdrawal or was secondary to his respiratory
distress.

Through postoperative day #4 and postoperative day #5, the
patient's agitation continued to worsen. On the morning of
[**2151-7-4**], the patient was found to have increased work of
breathing and deterioration in his mental status. Again, it
was unclear if this was secondary to his respiratory failure
or advanced signs of delirium tremens.

Per family wishes, and after consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] on
the morning of postoperative day #5, the patient was
successfully intubated. Several attempts were made at weaning
sedation and vent management, but the patient became
increasingly agitated and had difficulty breathing during
each of these events.

On [**2151-7-6**], the patient became hypotensive and dyspneic.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed, showing a high output
picture consistent with sepsis. The patient was started on
vancomycin, Zosyn, and Xigris. This septic picture continued
to evolve throughout the course of the day with final blood
gas of 7.15, 64, 24, -7. At that time, the patient's family
had become increasingly vocal regarding their wishes to
withdraw the patient's care. After several discussions,
including the patient's wife, 2 daughters, and a grandson,
decision was made to withdraw and make the patient comfort
measures only.

At approximately 2:30 in the morning on [**2151-7-8**], the
patient's drips, including Xigris, vasopressin and Levophed
were all discontinued. The ventilator, likewise, was stopped.
The patient expired shortly thereafter.

The medical examiner declined the case. The family likewise
declined autopsy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2152-11-29**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with phototherapy.

[**2152-12-1**]: bronchoscopy with tracheal mass debridement. There was
no evidence of any necrosis in that area, which suggest that
there is probably more granulation as compared to more tumor.
Tumor excission was done with the use of the microdebrider.
There was also evidence of severe malacia of trachea, especially
due to anterior movement of the posterior wall in the area
posterior to the tracheostomy tube.  Complete patency was
accomplished.

bronchoscopic and radiologic therapies. He was found to have
a large right hilar mass extending from the upper lobe into
the lower lobe and middle lobe, a bulky mediastinal
adenopathy and extension of the tumor up against the
esophagus. He underwent therapy with definitive chemotherapy
and chemotherapy and then was restaged. On restaging, he was
found to have a traumatic response, and therefore, his case
was discussed at the thoracic oncology multidisciplinary
center for possible salvage surgical resection. He underwent
a full metastatic workup including PET scan, MRI of the brain
and staging mediastinoscopy. He cleared all of his
mediastinal lymph nodes with the chemoradiotherapy and his
MRI of the brain and PET scan demonstrated no evidence of
metastatic disease and traumatic response of the tumor. We
therefore, after an extensive discussion with all doctors
involved as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as the patient, elected to take him forward
for a high-risk salvage pneumonectomy and omental flap.

pneumonectomy with rising wbc and low grade temps
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for abscess/infectious source s/p pneumonectomy
CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST

INDICATION: 55-year-old man with lung carcinoma status post
radiation and pneumonectomy with rising white blood count and
low-grade fever. Rule out abscess/infectious source status post
pneumonectomy.

COMPARISON: FDG-PET [**2153-6-13**] and [**2153-4-19**]

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
obtained following administration of oral contrast and 130 cc of
Optiray. Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also
obtained.

CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There is air seen in the subcutaneous tissues of the chest on
the left. Patient is status post right pneumonectomy. There is
hydropneumothorax seen on the right. There is air seen in the
mediastinum. Patient is status post mediastinal lymph node
dissection. There are no pathologically enlarged lymphatic node
seen in the mediastinum, hilar, or axillary regions. There are
calcifications seen in the coronary arteries. There is a patchy
opacity seen in the left upper lobe anteriorly, that could
represent post-radiation change. There are no other opacities or
lung nodules identified in the lung parenchyma. Trachea, left
main and segmental bronchi are patent. There is no pericardial
effusion seen.

CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Spleen, pancreas, liver,
gallbladder, stomach, duodenum are unremarkable. Abdominal loops
of large and small bowel are unremarkable. Adrenal glands are
unremarkable. Multiple lesions, heterogeneously hypoenhancing
compared to renal parenchyma are seen in kidneys bilaterally,
almost entirely replacing the right kidney. There are several
large masses also seen in the left kidney. There are abnormally
enlarged lymphatic nodes seen in the retroperitoneum, including
adjacent to right renal hilum between aorta and IVC, right
paraaortic, right retrocrural. The largest nodes are adjacent to
right renal hilum measuring approximately 20 mm in diameter and
right retrocrural measuring approximately 15 mm in diameter.
These nodes ,previously not FDG-avid on PET, significantly
increased in size compared to that previous examinations. There
is no free air and no free fluid in the abdomen. There is
extensive mesenteric peritoneal stranding in the abdomen, that
could be due to patient treatment/debilitation, but peritoneal
tumor involvement cannot definitively be excluded amd attention
on follow-up exam is recommeded.

CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon,
urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles are
unremarkable. There is no free fluid and no pathologically
enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymphatic nodes seen.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions in the skeletal structures. Thoracotomy signs seen in
the right posterior right rib. There are deformities, consistent
with old fractures seen in the right lateral fifth and sixth
ribs, and left fifth and sixth lateral ribs.

Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were reviewed, and
were essential in delineating anatomy and pathology as described
above.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple bilateral heterogeneously hypoenhancing renal
masses, highly suspicious for metastatic disease to kidneys.
Infection is also on the differential list. These lesions are
amendable to ultrasound-guided biopsy.
2. Pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymphatic nodes,
suspicious for tumor involvement.
3. Status post right pneumonectomy, there is hydropneumothorax
and. Subcutaneous emphysema.
4. Extensive mesenteric peritoneal stranding, that could be
consistent with debilitation, tumor involvement cannot be
excluded.

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
65 y/o female who has developed developed severe scoliosis with
draping of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius
overlying the scoliotic spine. This resulted in long-term
compression with underlying malacia and septic bronchiectasis
of the right lower and right middle lobe resulting in recurrent
infections yearly and dyspnea requiring supplemental oxygen
therapy when she is in her [**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 61361**].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right bronchomalacia s/p Right thorocotomy,right middle/lower
lobectomy, right bronchoplasty, T4 vertebrectomy ([**4-13**])
 Flexible bronchoscopy with extraction of thick tenacious
    sputum from right lower and right middle lobe and
    evaluation of airways.
2.  Right thoracotomy with bilobectomy, right lower lobectomy
    and right middle lobectomy.
3.  Bronchoplasty of right main bronchus with mesh.
4.  Pedicled intercostal muscle flap.
5.1) Partial vertebrectomy T5,6,7,;2) Fusion T5-8;3) Autograft.
6.  Multiple intercostal nerve blocks.


History of Present Illness:
65-
year-old woman who has developed severe scoliosis with
draping of the right main bronchus and bronchus intermedius
overlying the scoliotic spine. This resulted in long-term
compression with underlying malacia and septic bronchiectasis
of the right lower and right middle lobe. She develops
recurrent infections yearly and also becomes dyspneic
requiring supplemental oxygen therapy when she is in her
[**Location 27224**] of [**Location (un) 61361**]. We extensively evaluated her and
ultimately felt the best approach would be to perform a right
thoracotomy and likely a bilobectomy involving the right
lower and right middle lobe.
Secondarily, we felt it was necessary to perform an anterior
vertebrectomy to remove a chronic source of external
compression and then to perform a bronchoplasty with mesh to
reshape the airway to its normal configuration and strengthen
its back wall.

INDICATION: [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain removed. Assess for lung expansion.

There has been removal of a right-sided chest tube. A right
hydropneumothorax is without interval change with a small apical
pneumothorax component and a small to moderate amount of pleural
fluid on the right. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
Focal opacity adjacent to surgical chain sutures in the right
lower lobe is likely due to postoperative atelectasis and/or
contusion. Additional opacities in the right perihilar region
may reflect asymmetrical edema, atelectasis, or infection. Left
pleural effusion decreased in size in the interval. Finally, a
relatively spherical opacity in the right suprahilar region is
probably unchanged allowing for technical differences, and may
reflect a loculated component of pleural fluid given its sharp
but incomplete borders, and less likely focal parenchymal
abnormality.

[**2145-9-29**]: Left thoracotomy. Left upper lobectomy. Mediastinal
lymph node dissection
[**2145-10-1**]: OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a biopsy-proven cancer
arising from the left upper lobe. The cancer was 4 cm in size
and given the size of the tumor
we recommended an open approach.  The patient had limited
pulmonary function and we consented the patient for lobectomy,
but also were hopeful that the lesion could be resected by an
upper division segmentectomy.

GEN: NAD
HEENT: OP clear, edentulous, raspy voice
NECK: supple, full ROM, no LAD
CV: RRR, s1/s2
LUNGS: breath sounds bilaterally, diffuse wheezes
ABD: s/nt/nd
EXT: warm/dry
INCISION: well-approximating without evidence of infection

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**2145-10-3**]: Postoperative changes status post left upper
lobectomy with leftward mediastinal shift. There is a large left
hydropneumothorax with a left chest tube terminate within the
apical aspect of the hydropneumothorax. Near complete
atelectasis of the left lung with opacification of the left
bronchus and its visualized branches, suggesting mucous plug or
blood. Patchy ground-glass opacity throughout the right lung
concerning for developing pnemonia vs. edema. Mildly enlarged
main pulmonary artery measuring 3.7 cm.

CXR:
[**2145-10-7**]: The fluid component of the moderate left
hydropneumothorax is slightly increased. Subcutaneous gas in the
left chest wall is unchanged. Multifocal opacities in the right
upper and lower lung and left lower lobe are improved, possibly
due to improving pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable.
[**2145-10-5**]: left-sided hydropneumothorax is slightly decreased.
More focal parenchymal opacities, greatest in the right upper
lobe could represent aspiration. The heart size is mildly
enlarged, however, unchanged. There is mild tortuosity of the
aorta. An aortic valve replacement is unchanged in position.
Deformity of the left posterior rib is unchanged.
[**2145-10-2**]: the left apical lateral pneumothorax. However, in the
interval, a large pleural effusion has also developed, the
effusion occupies approximately two-thirds of the volume of the
left hemithorax. There is thus, now, a large fluidopneumothorax.
The left lateral air collection in the soft tissues is
unchanged. Also unchanged are the post-operative rib defects.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year-old female admitted [**2145-9-29**] for Left thoracotomy, Left
upper lobectomy.
Mediastinal lymph node dissection and Direct laryngoscopy with
operating telescope.
Local fold injection with Radiesse Voice gel. She was extubated
in the operating room, transfer to the PACU with a right chest,
Foley and Bupivacaine Epidural managed by the acute pain
service.  She transfer to the floor in stable condition.

Events: Chest CT [**2145-10-3**] negative for PE. Possible aspiration
Pneumonia on Right
Flexible bronchoscopy [**2145-10-4**] with BAL and large mucus plug
removal.

ID: spike temp 101, BAL with GNR, Ucx with E.coli, started on
Ceftriaxone. Outpatient antibiotics switched to PO cipro, with
fluconazole/clotrimazole for thrush seen on bronchoscopy.

Respiratory: aggressive nebs, ambulation, incentive spirometer;
her oxygen requirements improved with saturations of 95% @rest,
91-97% 1L activity

Chest-tube: left with moderate serousanguious discharge, removed
[**2145-10-5**].  Serial chest films showed left-sided
hydropneumothorax is slightly decreased, with slightly increased
fluid component. Focal parenchymal opacities showed improvement
by the day of discharge.

Cardiac: history of diastolic heart failure.  Her home
medications were titrated as her HR and blood pressure
tolerated.  She remained in sinus rhythm 70's blood pressure
110-140's.

GI: PPI and bowel regime.

Speech/Swallow: seen by speech for soft signs and possible
symptoms of aspiration
of thin liquids during today's bedside evaluation.  Given her
recent surgery and history, she is felt to be at high risk for
silent aspiration. pureed solids and nectar thick liquids were
started. Video-swallow [**2145-10-1**] no aspiration  safe for a PO
diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.

Laryngology followed for left vocal cord immobility. Voice
should improve over 1-2 weeks.  Mild hoarsness while
hospitalized

Endocrine: blood sugars initially 200-300's, insulin sliding
scale adjusted lantus 10 [**Hospital1 **] continued.  AM BS low 48-99.
[**Hospital1 **] consulted recommended d/c PM lantus and start humalog
sliding scale at 180. Her blood sugars improved, lantus PM dose
was slowly restarted prior discharge.

Renal: IV fluids were maintained until taking PO's. Urine output
improved. Gentle diureses was restarted on POD2.  Electrolytes
replete as needed

Pain: Bupivacaine/fentanyl Epidural managed by the acute pain
service.  The epidural was split on [**2145-10-1**] with Bupivacaine
and home MS Contin dose with good control.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking in [**2112**].  He had a
40-pack-year history of smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
temperature was 97 degrees Fahrenheit, his pulse was 64, his
blood pressure was 138/78, he was breathing at a rate of 18,
and he was saturating at 98% on room air.  The patient was in
no acute distress.  He was alert and oriented times three.
He had anicteric sclerae.  There were lymph nodes palpable in
his neck.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  The heart was regular in rate
and rhythm.  There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities
showed no peripheral edema, and no deformity.
Neurologically, the patient's cranial nerves II through XII
were grossly intact throughout.  The patient had 5/5 strength
and sensation throughout all extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman status
post chemoradiation treatment for stage IIIB lung cancer who
now presents with a new enlarging right lower lobe lesion.

The patient was scheduled for right video-assisted thoracic
surgery and wedge resection.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented on
[**2119-3-19**] for elective right video-assisted thoracic
surgery and wedge resection.  The patient was taken to the
operating room and tolerated the procedure well.  He was
transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.  The patient was mildly hypotensive and had a
reported history of hypotension after previous surgeries.

While the patient had a right-sided chest tube that was to
suction while in the Postanesthesia Care Unit, the nursing
staff noted the patient had a sudden increase in chest tube
output of bright red blood.  The patient had approximately
120 cc over 15 minutes which was a dramatic increase in rate
from when coming out of the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The
patient was also hypotensive; however, he was mentating well
and was not tachycardic.

A chest x-ray was obtained which showed no evidence of an
effusion or hemothorax.  The patient was rolled onto
dependent position which did not produce a gush of blood.
The patient was examined by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**] and was felt
should be re-explored for control of the bleed.

The patient was brought back to the operating room and was
found to have bleeding from one of the port sites.  This was
cauterized, and the patient was transferred again back to the
Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day one, the patient required a
Neo-Synephrine drip overnight to maintain mean arterial
pressures above 60.  The patient was given several fluid
boluses and had good urine output.  He was not tachycardic
but continued to have persistently low blood pressures in the
90s/50 with mean arterial pressures in the 60s; requiring a
Neo-Synephrine drip.  Over the course of the day on
postoperative day one, the patient was gradually weaned off
the Neo-Synephrine drip.  The patient's Foley catheter was
removed.  The chest tube was also removed.  A postoperative
chest x-ray was obtained which showed no change after removal
of his chest tube.  The patient's diet was advanced.  The
patient passed a voiding trial.  He was taking oral intake.
Felt that despite the patient looking good that he should
stay one more night.   The patient was transferred to the
floor off of all drips, tolerating a regular diet, and
ambulating without assistance.

On postoperative day two, the patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient was on a regular diet and
was ambulating well.  The patient's examination was
unremarkable.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged to home on
postoperative day two with followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**] in
one week.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Altace 10 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Ibuprofen 600-mg tablets by mouth three times per day
(for three days).
6.  Hydromorphone 2-mg tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Hilar carcinoma of the lung.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Hilar carcinoma of the lung, pending
pathology, status post right pneumonectomy.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cough and a cold.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old African
American female who presented to the Emergency Department in
early [**Month (only) **] due to cough and some shortness of breath.
She had previously been admitted to the hospital for
shortness of breath in [**2189**], at which time a chest x-ray was
done and said to be normal, and the patient was discharged
home on an Albuterol inhaler.  She had remained asymptomatic
until the aforementioned visit to the Emergency Department,
at which time a repeat chest x-ray showed the presence of a
large right hilar mass which was associated with volume loss
in the right hemithorax, and suggestive of a neoplasm of the
lung.  She denied having any history of fever, chills, chest
pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea.  She also
denied any history of lower extremity edema.  She stated that
her appetite had been good, however, she had experienced an
approximately ten pound weight loss over the previous two
months.  A biopsy was performed of her hilar mass which was
consistent with a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.  She also
underwent a bone scan in a workup for metastases but this did
not reveal any such disease.  She underwent further imaging
with CAT scan of the hilar mass and it was staged as a T3,
NO, MO lesion, and was believed to be amenable to primary
resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Status post benign breast biopsy in [**2188**], and a
lumpectomy in [**2177**].
4.  Cataract disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Diltiazem 180 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Albuterol meter dose inhaler.
3.  Lipitor.
4.  Steroid meter dose inhaler.
5.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reports an allergy to Penicillin
which she states causes swelling, itching, and rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home alone.  She quit
smoking one month prior to presentation at the Emergency
Department.  She does have an extensive tobacco history
having smoked two packs per week for forty years.  She also
drinks alcohol on which she states to be a regular basis.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for breast cancer and diabetes
mellitus in her mother.  There is no family history of
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, she
was found to be afebrile with a heart rate of 90 and sinus
rhythm and a blood pressure of 110/70.  Her height was five
feet and her weight was 110 pounds.  She was a pleasant 73
year old woman in no acute distress. Her pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  The neck was supple with no jugular
venous distention.  Her carotid arteries were 2+ palpable
with no audible bruits.  She had no lymphadenopathy.  Her
heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2
heart sounds and no murmurs.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally with good air entry and movement,
however, she did have bilateral expiratory wheezing which was
quite significant.  Examination of her breasts revealed no
masses on palpation with no nipple discharge or tenderness.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with no
hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  Neurologically,
she was alert and oriented to person, place and time and
motor and sensory systems were grossly intact.  Her
extremities were warm and dry with palpable pedal pulses and
no lower extremities edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her complete blood count done just prior to
admission showed a white blood cell count of 7.0 with a
hematocrit of 40.4 and platelet count of 469,000.  Her
chemistries done just prior to admission were significant for
a sodium of 138, potassium 2.8.  She was also found to have a
slightly elevated cortisol level at 24.

Preadmission radiologic studies of significance was a chest
x-ray performed on [**2191-11-1**], which showed a new right hilar
mass.  This was further confirmed by CAT scan which showed a
large [**Location (un) 21851**] in the right hilum resulting in
obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus and severe
compression of the intermediate bronchus.  It also showed
multiple ill-defined areas of opacity within the right upper
lobe.  The patient further underwent a bone scan which showed
no evidence of bony metastases and a CAT scan of the head
which showed no abnormalities.  Ventilation perfusion scan
was also performed which showed right lung perfusion to be
25% of the total.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating
room on [**2191-12-20**], where she underwent a pneumonectomy of the
right lung as well as bronchoscopy and a pericardial flap.
Please see the operative note for full details of this
procedure.  The right lung as well as hilar lymph nodes were
sent to pathology for further examination.  Two chest tubes
were placed at the time of surgery, and the patient was
transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit following continued intubation
and a need for Neo-Synephrine to maintain her blood pressure.
She was at this time on continuous epidural at 4 cc/hour for
pain control.  The patient self extubated herself at
approximately 6:30 p.m. on postoperative day number zero.
She appeared to tolerate this well as she was alert and
oriented and breathing fairly comfortably.  Her oxygen
saturation at the time remained greater than 90%.  On
postoperative day number one, she was alert and oriented to
person, place and time.  She was maintaining her heart rate
in the 60s to 70s with her Neo-Synephrine drip being titrated
to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 100.   The
Neo-Synephrine drip had been able to be shut off for several
hours during the night.  She began to experience some greater
incisional discomfort, at which time her epidural rate was
increased to 5 cc/hour.  She was encouraged to perform
aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry with
which her oxygen saturations and level of pain improved.  She
was able to be weaned off her Neo-Synephrine drip completely
towards the end of postoperative day number one.  Her pain
was excellently controlled with her epidural running at a
rate of 5 cc/hour.  Her relative hypoxia and respiratory
acidosis were slowly being corrected through aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  On postoperative day number two, she was
found to be alert and oriented to person, place and time.
She was in sinus rhythm.  One of her chest tubes was removed
at this time which she tolerated without difficulty.  She was
subsequently transferred to the floor later on postoperative
day number two.  During the mid afternoon on postoperative
day number two, the patient went from a sinus rhythm into
rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 140s and
a systolic blood pressure between 80 and 90.  She was given a
slow 500 cc bolus of normal saline, and proceeded to convert
in and out of atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm throughout
much of the afternoon.  She then went into a sustained rapid
atrial fibrillation, and an Amiodarone intravenous bolus of
150 mg was given over ten minutes and then infusion of
Amiodarone at 1 mg/minute was started.  She continued on this
overnight and converted her rhythm back to sinus rhythm
during the night which she sustained.  She was started on
oral Amiodarone the following morning, postoperative day
number three, at 400 mg twice a day.  Her systolic blood
pressure slowly improved and came into the 120 to 130 range.
She continued to improve remaining in sinus rhythm, and due
to her improving blood pressure was restarted on her
Diltiazem which she had been on prior to admission.  She had
excellent pain control and her epidural was quickly weaned.
On postoperative day number four, following chest x-ray which
showed evidence of only a very slight pneumothorax, her
second chest tube was removed.  She subsequently had her
dural and Foley catheters removed, all of which she tolerated
extremely well.  During the next day and one half, the
patient did very well on the floor, increasing her level of
activity with the assistance of physical therapy and the
nursing staff.  On postoperative day number four, it was felt
that the patient was ready for discharge from the hospital.
It was felt at this time that due to the extensive number of
stairs in her home and the fact that she lived alone that she
would benefit from a short stay at a skilled care nursing
facility.  She was stable and ready for discharge on
postoperative day number five, at which time she found a
skilled nursing care facility bed.  At that time, her
physical examination was significant for a temperature of
99.2, heart rate 100 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 118/70,
respiratory rate 18 with an oxygen saturation 99% on two
liters of nasal cannula.   Her most complete blood count from
[**2191-12-24**], showed a white blood cell count of 8.8, hematocrit
33.8 and a platelet count of 469,000.  Her electrolytes on
[**2191-12-24**], showed a sodium of 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 95,
bicarbonate 31, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.5, with
a blood glucose of 135.  Magnesium at the time was 1.9.  On
physical examination, she was alert and oriented to person,
place and time, moving all extremities and following all
commands.  Her heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with
normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs.  She had good air entry and
movement over the left lung field which was clear to
auscultation.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Her sternotomy incision was healing nicely and
her sternum was stable.  Her incisions were open to air,
clean and dry.  Her extremities were warm and well perfused
with no evidence of pedal edema.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Diltiazem 180 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Acetaminophen 1000 mg p.o. q6hours as needed for pain.
4.  Albuterol-Ipratropium inhaler one to two puffs every six
hours as needed.

DIET:  At discharge, her diet was as tolerated.

ACTIVITY:  Her activity was also as tolerated with probable
benefit from some additional skilled care to increase
strength and mobility particularly in climbing stairs.

DISPOSITION:  To the [**Hospital3 537**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
man, with a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and a former smoking history.  In the Fall of [**2113**],
he developed evidence of pneumonia in the right upper lobe,
treated with antibiotics.  His symptoms resolved, but the
lesion in the right upper lobe persisted.  CT scans suggested
malignancy, and operation was advised.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Coronary artery disease with previous coronary bypass.

A preoperative PET scan was consistent with malignant process
without signs of metastasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, I performed a
bronchoscopy followed by a right upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Operation went well.  The
patient was extubated in the operating room.  He had a small,
persistent air leak, but his chest tubes were able to be
removed on the fourth postoperative day.  He completed
rehabilitation and was discharged on the fifth postoperative
day on his usual medications and pain medication.  Follow-up
in the Thoracic Oncology Center was arranged.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 51497**] is a 61 year-old male
with a one year history of nonsmall cell lung cancer who was
transferred from an outside hospital to Cardiothoracic Surgery on
[**2145-9-30**].  The patient originally presented to the outside
hospital on [**9-18**] with nausea and vomiting and found to have
a small bowel obstruction.  A CT of the chest also revealed a
right sided pleural effusion as well as an obstructing right
upper lobe mass.  CT scan of the abdomen showed small bowel
obstruction secondary to diffuse abdominal metastases and the
patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with small bowel
resection on [**9-23**].  His postoperative course was complicated
by fevers and he was initially treated with Zosyn.  By report all
blood and urine cultures were negative.  The patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-30**]
for further management of the right upper lobe obstructing mass.
On admission the patient denies any chest pain, shortness of
breath or dizziness.  He did complain of a cough productive of
clear sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage four nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2144-9-3**] status post chemo/radiation with metastases to the
abdomen.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Small bowel obstruction secondary to abdominal mets
status post small bowel resection.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME PRIOR TO HOSPITAL ADMISSION:  Prednisone
20 mg po q day started by the patient's primary care
physician for shortness of breath.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was an electrician with the
[**State 350**] National Guard.  He retired last year.  He lives on
[**Location (un) **].  He has never been married and has no children.  The
patient has a 30 pack year cigarette smoking history.  He quit in
the [**2122**].  He drinks every once in a while and denies any
intravenous or recreational drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient denies any family history of cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICINE SERVICE:
Temperature max 98.9.  Current temperature 98.8.  Blood
pressure 145/84.  Heart rate 97.  Respiratory rate 20.
Oxygen saturation 98% on 1 liter nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient is awake, alert, appears his stated age and in no
acute distress.  He is cooperative with the examination, but
very grouchy.  HEENT examination pupils are round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Sclera
anicteric.  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  Chest
examination coarse breath sounds on the right greater then
left, no wheezing, no dullness to percussion with decreased
breath sounds at the right lung base.  Cardiovascular
examination regular rate and rhythm.  Abdominal examination
soft, nontender, nondistended with good bowel sounds.  A well
healing midline scar with mild erythema.  Extremities no
lower extremity edema.  Neurological examination alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly
intact.  Strength 5 out of 5 in the upper and lower
extremities.  Sensation intact to light touch in the upper
and lower extremities.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER FROM THE CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
SERVICE TO THE MEDICINE SERVICE:  White blood cell count is
4.4, hematocrit 26.4, platelets 399, creatinine 0.7, glucose
112.  Chest x-ray shows large medial right upper lobe mass
with opacification at the right heart border due to collapse
or consolidation of the right lower lobe.  There is an
irregular pleural thickening on the right apex as well as the
chest wall.  There is a hydropneumothorax at the right apex.
The left lung is clear with gross interstitial markings.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Lung cancer:  The patient was transferred
from an outside hospital following small bowel resection for
further management of the right upper lobe obstructing tumor. The
patient was initially admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service.
Interventional pulmonary was consulted.  On [**10-1**]
interventional pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy with
placement of the right upper lobe stent.  A chest tube was also
placed into the right chest wall for evacuation of the right
pleural effusion.  Steroids, which had been started at the
outside hospital were continued for the patient's wheezing and
dyspnea.  On [**10-4**] the chest tube was removed following
resolution of the pleural effusion.  The patient's steroids were
slowly tapered over the course of a week.  Zosyn had also been
started at the outside hospital for postoperative fever and the
patient was continued on Zosyn intravenously.  He was eventually
switched to Flagyl and Levofloxacin po and received a total of 18
days of antibiotics.  His postoperative fever was believed to be
due initially to postoperative pneumonia, however, the patient
continued to have low grade fevers to 100 despite antibiotics.
Multiple blood cultures and sputum cultures and urine cultures
were obtained, which were all negative. It was believed that the
continued fevers on antibiotics was possibly due to either tumor
fever or a drug reaction to the antibiotics.  Following stent
placement and chest tube removal the patient continued to have
intermittent shortness of breath and worsening cough and he was
taken by interventional pulmonary for a repeat bronchoscopy on
[**10-12**] for removal of mucous plug.  Following this
repeat bronch the patient symptomatically felt better, but
continued to require oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 liters.

Following discussion with the patient, interventional pulmonary
decided to attempt photodynamic therapy.  On [**10-8**] he
received his infusion of Photofrin followed by light treatment on
[**10-12**] and finally a bronchoscopy to clean out necrotic
tissue on [**10-13**].  The patient tolerated this procedure
well without any complications. Throughout the hospital course
the patient was continued on aggressive chest CT, incentive
spirometry, Albuterol nebulizers, Atrovent nebulizers and cough
syrup.  A physical therapy consult was obtained and they
determined that he would require outpatient chest physical
therapy as well as home oxygen therapy.  At the time of discharge
the patient's cough and shortness of breath had much improved and
he was arranged to follow up with outpatient chest physical
therapy.

2.  Fever:  The patient was transferred from an outside hospital
on Zosyn intravenously for postoperative fever.  It was believed
the cause of his fevers to be due to a post obstructive
pneumonia.  He was continued on Zosyn intravenously initially in
his hospital course and was eventually switched to po antibiotics
when the patient was tolerating po well.  He was started on
Flagyl and Levofloxacin to complete the total 18 day antibiotic
course. The patient continued to have low grade fevers to 100
despite these antibiotics.  Multiple blood cultures, urine
cultures and sputum cultures all returned negative.  It was
believed the cause of his continued fevers to be due to either
tumor fever or drug reaction.

3.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, which was detected at the outside hospital.
At [**Hospital1 69**] the patient had one brief
10 second episode of what appeared to be atrial fibrillation. The
patient was asymptomatic during this episode.  The patient had no
further episodes of atrial fibrillation throughout the remainder
of the hospital course.

4.  Small bowel obstruction:  The patient had a small bowel
resection on [**9-23**] at the outside hospital for small bowel
obstruction due to lung metastases.  At the time of transfer the
patient was tolerating po and having bowel movements and he
continued to have [**Last Name **] problem throughout the remainder of his
hospital course.

5.  Diarrhea:  The patient complained of multiple loose bowel
movements - up to four bowel movements a day.  Multiple samples
were tested for C-diff all of which returned negative and the
patient's diarrhea eventually subsided.  No cause was found for
this diarrhea.

6.  Anemia:  On transfer to [**Hospital1 69**]
the patient's hematocrit was 26.  Anemia studies were consistent
with an anemia of chronic disease, although the patient was
already on iron supplements.  His hematocrit remained stable at
26 throughout most of the hospital course. On the day prior to
discharge his hematocrit decreased to 23.5.  A repeat hematocrit
confirmed this decrease and the patient received 1 unit of packed
red blood cells.  The morning following his transfusion his
hematocrit had appropriately increased.  The patient's stool was
also tested for blood, but found to be guaiac negative. He was
discharged on his iron supplements.

7.  Methemoglobinemia:  On [**10-11**] while receiving his light
treatment the patient's O2 sats dropped to 54%.  An arterial
blood gas showed 16% methemoglobinemia and the patient received
Methylene blue times one dose empirically. The cause for his
methemoglobinemia was believed to be due to the Lidocaine with a
possible contribution for Metoclopramide, which the patient had
been taking for nausea and vomiting and from Benzonatate, which
the patient had been taking for his cough.  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation
following the procedure.  His O2 sats remained stable and he
developed no signs of symptoms of cyanosis, so the following day
he was able to be transferred back to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged back to his home in
[**Hospital3 **].  His sister will be living with him and he will be
receiving chest physical therapy as an outpatient.  The patient
was also discharged with home O2.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Malignant pleural effusion.
2.  Stage four nonsmall cell lung cancer status post right
bronch stent placement and photodynamic therapy.
3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4.  Anemia of chronic disease.
5.  Methemoglobinemia.
6.  Small bowel obstruction status post small bowel
resection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Iron polysaccharide complex 150 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day for two more days.
3.  Metronidazole 500 mg po t.i.d. for two more days.
4.  Metoprolol 125 mg po b.i.d.
5.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety.
6.  Megestrol 40 mg po t.i.d.
7.  Guaifenesin/dextromethorphan syrup po q 4 hours prn
cough.
8.  Albuterol one puff inhaled 4 to 6 hours prn.
9.  Ipratropium one puff q 6 hours prn.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is asked to follow up with his
oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51498**] at [**Hospital 40262**] Hospital for further
chemotherapy.  The patient prior to hospital admission had
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51498**] trying another round of chemotherapy
after the patient regained his strength.  He is also asked to
follow up with his primary care physician in one to two weeks.
The patient was also given information concerning his outpatient
chest rehab.

Date of Birth:                    Sex:

Service:  THORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old
male with a twenty three year history of smoking,
discontinued approximately fifteen years ago who presented
with a few months of stabbing and burning sensation over his
face, extremities and torso.  Symptoms were worse at his
palms, feet and face and tongue.  The symptoms improved
somewhat with Neurontin.  Given his symptoms the patient had
an extensive workup which revealed a right lower lobe lung
mass.  The MRI of the head and spine was negative.  A CAT
scan was performed, which confirmed the mass in the right
lower lobe.  No obvious lymphadenopathy was seen.  The
patient was admitted for staging and a possible surgical
intervention given no gross involvement of his lymph nodes.
The patient had bone pain.  A PET scan was positive for
primary disease, but no other involvement was observed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Neurontin 300 mg q day.  2.
Lipitor 40 mg q.d.  3.  Lisinopril 20 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Use of tobacco for approximately twenty
three years.  Quit fifteen years ago.  Moderate alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alert and oriented and in no acute
distress.  Vital signs temperature 98.1.  Heart rate 101.
Blood pressure 120/84.  Oxygenation 97% on room air.  HEENT
examination no JVD.  No masses.  No lymphadenopathy palpable.
Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.  Chest clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended without
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities no edema, warm and well
perfuse.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 9.2, hematocrit
40.2, platelets 308.  Glucose 78, BUN 13, creatinine 0.8,
sodium 138, potassium 4.4.  Chest x-ray preoperatively showed
a 2.6 by 1.6 cm right base pulmonary nodule, which was
consistent with a given history of lung cancer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Thoracic
Surgery for further evaluation and management of his lung
cancer.  On [**2145-8-24**] the patient underwent bronchoscopy,
mediastinoscopy, followed by right lower lobectomy.  The
pathology showed adenocarcinoma that was moderately
differentiated with predominantly papillary features and
bronchial alveolar pattern.  The bronchoscopy was normal.
The frozen section was negative for metastatic disease.  The
procedure was without any complications.  Estimated blood
loss was 100 cc.  Please see the full operative note for
further details.

The patient's pain was controlled with the epidural.  He was
transported to the regular floor in stable condition.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet was initiated.  On [**2145-8-26**] in the
evening the patient was noted to have low oxygen saturation
and to be producing copious secretions out of his mouth.
Given his unstable condition a code was called.  Gastric
contents were noted to be bubbling out of the patient's mouth
and he appeared obtunded when the code team arrived.  He was
intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  The
chest x-ray at the time showed persistent evidence of
loculated basal and pneumothorax on the right side and
parenchymal density on the right side was suspicious for
aspiration.  Bilateral central pulmonary densities were
thought to most likely represent pulmonary edema.  The blood
gas at the time showed significant respiratory acidosis.  The
patient was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.  Tube feeding
was initiated through a nasogastric tube.  Bronchoscopy was
performed, which revealed copious secretions bilaterally and
culture of the secretions revealed gram negative rods.

On [**2145-8-31**] the patient spiked a temperature of 102
consequently Vancomycin was added to the antibiotic regimen
and blood cultures were sent, which were all negative.  A
repeat sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was
pan sensitive.  The patient was continued to be monitored
centrally.  The patient continued to receive bronchoscopies,
which again revealed large amount of thick secretions.  The
patient's antibiotic regimen was continued as the vancomycin,
Flagyl and Ceftriaxone.  The patient continued to have low
grade fevers.  His urine culture from [**8-31**] grew enterococcus.
The patient's sedation was minimized.  Infectious disease was
consulted on [**2145-9-2**] given persistent fevers.  The infectious
disease consult recommended clostridium difficile given the
history of antibiotic use during hospitalization, to continue
Vancomycin, start Zosyn to cover microsomal pathogens.  The
patient was also diuresed to help differentiate infiltrates
from pulmonary edema.  A CT scan with and without contrast
was performed on [**2145-9-2**] to evaluate for possibility of a
stroke.  The CAT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage or
stroke at the time.  The scan was performed given decreased
movement of the lower extremities and decreased response to
stimuli.  In addition a PET scan of the abdomen was performed
on [**2145-9-2**] to rule out fluid collection.  No fluid collection
was seen.  Physical therapy was consulted, which continued to
follow the patient.

The patient was being slowly weaned off the ventilator.  The
infectious disease workup did not show any clear source of
his fevers given the coverage with antibiotics.  The
patient's prolonged respiratory failure was thought to be
consistent with ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome).
Chest x-ray done on [**2145-9-7**] did not show any significant
improvement.  On [**2145-9-7**] the patient complained of right
upper quadrant pain and continued to have elevated white
blood cell count.  Ultrasound of the gallbladder was
performed, which showed no evidence of cholecystitis and
showed echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Follow up bronchoscopies showed a decrease amount of
secretions.  The patient did have periods of increased
agitation and confusion.  Given the history of alcohol use in
the past his symptoms and signs were closely monitored.  On
[**2145-9-8**] the patient was extubated.  He appeared agitated and
congested afterwards.  He had copious amounts of thick yellow
secretions.  Follow up chest x-ray showed little change in
the amount of infiltrates.  The patient's blood gas was
improved.  The patient's sputum grew Klebsiella.  He was
continued on Zosyn and Vancomycin.  On [**2145-9-10**] the patient
appeared to have decreasing white blood cell count,
decreasing infiltrate on the chest x-ray and no more fever
spikes, although he continues to have low grade temperatures.
He continued to bring copious amounts of secretions and
continued to be in a rather tenuous respiratory status after
being extubated a few days earlier.

The patient continued to receive aggressive chest therapy to
relieve his congestion.  The patient was transfused with
packed red blood cells on [**2145-9-13**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient continued to slowly improve
while in the Intensive Care Unit.  He completed a full
recommended course of intravenous Zosyn.  On [**2145-9-15**], ................... lavage obtained from a bronchoscopy
showed a Staphylococcus aureus that was MRSA but sensitive to
Vancomycin.  The patient still continued to have mild
leukocytosis.  Given the sensitivities, intravenous
Vancomycin was started on [**2145-9-20**].

On [**2145-9-20**], a speech and swallow test was
performed.  Speech and swallow test showed increased risk of
aspiration.  The patient was transferred to the regular floor
on [**2145-9-24**].  The patient was continued on tube feeds.
The patient still continued to have a moderate amount of
secretions that were mostly yellowish in color and thick in
consistency.  The patient was continued on intravenous
Vancomycin.

The patient was ambulating.  His chest x-ray showed some
interval improvement.  The patient remained in regular
rhythm.  He was tolerating his tube feeds well.  A
video-assisted speech and swallow was repeated on [**2145-9-27**], which still showed the risk of aspiration.  The patient
was discharged to the rehabilitation facility on [**2145-9-29**], in stable condition.

Service: THORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 38 year old female at work
developed a left back pain radiating to the anterior chest.
The patient had a history of asthma and the patient took her
inhalers and had some relief of symptoms.  The patient
eventually went to [**Hospital6 1597**] where a chest x-ray
was obtained and found a right lung mass.  The patient stated
she had an episode of bronchitis approximately ten years
prior with wheezing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Nebulizers and birth control
pills.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Occasional alcohol and no smoking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Cardiac disease on both sides of the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had anicteric sclera, in
no apparent distress.  Examination of the lungs revealed
clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezing.
Examination of the heart revealed regular rate and rhythm
without any murmurs.  Examination of the abdomen revealed
soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.  Examination of the
extremities revealed no edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Thoracic
Surgery Service and the patient underwent lobectomy of the
right middle lobe and right lower lobe to remove a central
tumor impinging on the right middle lobe and right lower lobe
bronchus.  The patient did well from the surgery.
Postoperatively the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  The patient's pain was controlled with epidural and
the chest tube was removed on the first day which was done in
error.  The patient was clinically stable but had developed a
hydropneumothorax.  The patient underwent a thoracostomy tube
to replace the chest tube.  The patient underwent that
placement of the chest tube without any difficulties.  The
patient had an epidural for pain.  The patient continued
having the chest tube which had some air leak.  The patient
appears to be out of bed to chair.  The patient's diet was
advanced.

On postoperative day #3, the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient's pain was continued to be
well controlled and the patient had on x-ray improvement of
the right upper lobe essentially but there was still residual
pneumothorax on the right side.  The patient was continued on
chest tube.  On postoperative day #4 the patient continued to
do well, remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's epidural was removed and the patient was put on
PCA.  Another chest x-ray was obtained which showed improved
expansion of the remaining portion of the right lung
following chest tube placement and moderate size of the
pneumothorax.  On postoperative day #5, the patient continued
to do well and remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient continued to have pneumothorax on the chest
x-ray, so the chest tube was still left in place.

The patient had removal of the chest tube on postoperative
day #5 after demonstration of no air leak and a stable x-ray
appearence. The chest tube
was removed subsequently where the patient experienced chest
pain and associated shortness of breath which was resolved.
A follow-up chest x-ray revealed that the patient
had a significantly larger pneumothorax requiring a chest tube
placement.
The patient underwent placement of the chest tube in the
Intensive Care Unit with sedation.  On postoperative day #6,
the patient continued to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
Chest x-ray revealed the patient continued to
hydropneumothorax.  The patient was continued on a chest
tube.

On postoperative day #7, the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient's chest tube was clamped and
chest x-ray was obtained.  Chest x-ray revealed stable
hydropneumothorax.  The chest tube was removed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**],
and the patient was discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post right lower lobe and right
middle lobe lobectomy.

radiation therapy distantly.  She has suffered from
fibrothorax secondary to radiation therapy and had a
restrictive airway disease.  She has had a prior
pericardectomy for restriction pericarditis.  Her radiation
therapy was in [**2110**] and restrictive disease left her on home
oxygen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post radiation therapy in [**2110**]
complicated by fibrothorax and restrictive pericarditis.
2.  Status post splenectomy for a staging laparotomy.
3.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
4.  Restrictive lung disease requiring home oxygen.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a very strong family support
system who have been quite helpful with her recovery.

13.  Artifical Tears p.r.n.
14.  Percocet elixir 5 mL to 10 mL q.4-6h. p.r.n. via the
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to INTRAVENOUS DYE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   The patient's lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  There were no
effusions.  Her heart rate was regular with a normal first
heart sound and second heart sound.  There were no murmurs.
Her abdomen was soft, benign, nontender, and nondistended.
The tenderness and erythema near her percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube site was nearly resolved.  She had a small
drain at this site which was to be discontinued at a later
date.  The patient had mild peripheral edema which had
improved on Lasix over the course of her postoperative
recovery.  She had no neurologic status, and her mental
status was excellent.  She communicated via a marker board,
but was being trained in how to use the fenestrate
tracheostomy tube.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory values
revealed a white blood cell count of 12,000, hematocrit
of 27, platelets of 384.  Sodium of 135, potassium of 3.5
(her potassium may need to be followed on Lasix), chloride
of 95, bicarbonate of 32, blood urea nitrogen of 20,
creatinine of 0.4, blood glucose of 119.  Magnesium of 2,
phosphate of 3.2, calcium of 8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A repeat chest x-rays with the Heimlich
valve in place have demonstrated her lung to be fully
expanded.  Termination of the chest tube will be dependent on
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2138-6-11**], the patient had a left
decortication in the operating room.  The patient had a
failure to wean postoperatively, and her postoperative course
was complicated by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterobacter pneumonia.  A tracheostomy was
performed on [**6-20**].

On [**7-1**], she began to tolerate tracheostomy collar for
prolonged periods of time.  On [**6-30**], off the ventilator,
her air leak stopped.  She began to take more oral intake at
this time.  She was receiving tube feeds via a postpyloric
feeding tube.  On [**7-1**], her antibiotics were stopped.  She
received a full course of vancomycin and ceftazidime.

On [**7-4**], a Heimlich valve was attached to her chest tube.
She received a bronchoscopy and a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube was placed.  Her central line was removed at
this time as well.

On [**7-6**], she developed an elevated white blood cell count
and fevers.  She was noted to have a cellulitis around her
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site.  A small drain
was placed beside the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube site, and some pus was removed.  The site is now
adequately drained, and the cellulitis nearly resolved.  She
was to receive a 2-week course of p.o. clindamycin (begun on
[**7-6**]).

She was on a regular diet, but her calorie counts have been
somewhat low, so she was receiving tube feeds.  She is
presently receiving 45 cc per hour of full-strength Respalor
tube feeds through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube.  As her oral intake improves, we anticipate that her
tube feedings will be able to be cut down and eventually
stopped.

A fenestrated tracheostomy tube was placed on [**7-8**].  At the
time of discharge, her fevers had subsided and white blood
cell count returned to [**Location 213**].  She was receiving vigorous
physical therapy and was able to walk across the length of
the Intensive Care Unit unassisted.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post left decortication.
2.  Status post tracheostomy.
3.  Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

DISCHARGE ACTIVITY:  The patient's activity is as tolerated,
and she should tolerate aggressive physical therapy.

DISCHARGE DIET:  She was tolerating a regular diet but needs
to improve her oral intake.    Her tube feedings should be
weaned as her oral intake improves.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]
one week following discharge.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Chemotherapy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
66 y.o. female with a h/o severe PVD including AAA status post
repair and stenting, and metastatic Ca of unknown
primary complicated by T7 destructive lesion here in [**12-26**], s/p
T3-T11 fusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] status post radiation with left
pelvic
metastasis, s/p XRT to chest and cervical subcutaneous soft
tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer metastasis
and paraneoplastic syndrome manifest with diffuse lower
extremity weakness who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from her rehab for
initiation of chemotherapy.

She was started on IVIG for paraneoplastic weakness during her
recent admission ([**2102-4-27**] to [**2102-5-31**]) and discharged to rehab
where she did not continue to receive IVIG. She was seen in
clinic today with noted growth of her neck mass with associated
[**2104-7-28**] pain in right shoulder despite current pain medication
regimen.
.
She is being admitted for chemotherapy
carboplatin/etoposide(over 3 days) and received day 1 today with
2 more days of etoposide. Pain control is the other objective of
her admission.
.
She states that other than the growth of her neck mass and
associated right shoulder pain, she has no other specific
complaints or concerns. Her weakness in her lower extremities
improved status post IVIG so that she can now move both feet and
has some fine motor control of both hands (right-handed) as she
is now able to stitch which she could not do before.  She also
reports numbness of LE b/l that is unchanged since IVIG and
paresthesias in UE b/l.  She has sensation in both her legs
below the knee which is also improved from prior.

CT [**6-30**]:

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Air bronchogram
containing right
lower lobe consolidation is not significantly changed from [**5-4**], [**2101**]
examination. Additionally, more anteriorly within the right
lower lobe, a new
4-mm pulmonary ground-glass nodule is noted. Post-radiation
changes along the
mediastinum bilaterally including scattered regions of
ground-glass opacity
and linear fibrosis are stable. Large left infrahilar mass is
grossly stable
from [**5-4**] examination but significantly increased from
[**2101-11-18**]
examination measuring 18 x 24 mm currently and displays mass
effect on the
adjacent lower lobe bronchus. No pleural or pericardial effusion
is
identified. 14-mm right axillary enhancing node has
significantly increased
in size from [**Month (only) 116**] examination where it measured approximately 7
mm. Additional
nodes within the mediastinum are grossly stable, the largest
subcarinally
measuring 7 mm in short axis. No pleural or pericardial effusion
is
identified. Mild coronary artery calcification and aortic
calcification is
again noted. Large soft tissue lesion posterior to T1 has also
increased in
size from [**Month (only) 116**] examination from 33 x 52 mm to 38 x 74 mm on
today's exam (3:1).
Hypoattenuating thyroid lesions are noted within the isthmus and
lower lobes
bilaterally. Increased soft tissue is also noted surrounding the
bronchus
intermedius, not present on [**2102-4-20**] exam.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: The liver,
spleen,
stomach, small bowel, adrenal glands, and left kidney appear
unremarkable.
Atrophic right kidney with mild rim-enhancing normal parenchyma
within the
upper pole is again noted. Prior [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] bypass including
bifemoral bypass
and bypass supplying the left renal artery are again noted and
remain patent.
No free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
are identified
within the abdominal cavity.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST: Intrapelvic
bowel,
uterus, and urinary bladder appear normal. No free fluid or
pathologically
enlarged lymph nodes are present within the pelvic cavity.
Multiple small
soft tissue attenuating lesions are noted within the anterior
abdominal wall,
increased from [**2101-10-20**] exam. Increased mild anasarca is
also noted
within the surrounding soft tissues.

BONE WINDOWS: Healing left superior and inferior rami pubic
fractures are
again noted and there is stable appearance to osseous harvest
site along the
left ilium. No malignant-appearing osseous foci are identified.
Extensive
thoracic spine surgical spine hardware remains in position.

IMPRESSION:
1. Enlargement of known metastatic C7-T1 posterior soft tissue
lesion.
Increased size to single left axillary lymph node and increased
mediastinal
soft tissue surrounding the right bronchus intermedius are all
worrisome for
progression of disease. The right axilla node is atypical for
lung cancer and
may warrant breast evaluation.

2. Stable left infrahilar mass from [**Month (only) 116**] examination but
significant
progression from [**2101-10-20**] examination. Mild mass effect on
the adjacent
left lower lobe bronchi. Single new right lower lobe
ground-glass pulmonary
nodule, likely inflammatory or infectious, but should be
followed up on
subsequent exams.

3. Stable right lower lobe consolidation. In absence of response
to
antibiotics, a cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or post
obstructive/radiation
induced pneumonitis are also within the differential.

4. Multiple new soft tissue nodules within the anterior
abdominal wall,
likely related to injections. Attention needed on followup
exams.

5. Hypoattenuating isthmic and thyroid lesions, likely benign.
If clinically
indicated, this could be further evaluated with dedicated
thyroid ultrasound
if not already completed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 66 year-old female with a history of small cell lung CA,
COPD, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, and paraneoplastic neurologic
disorder who was initially admitted for chemotherapy and
eventually transferred to the ICU on [**7-14**] for hypoxia,
tachycardia, and mental status changes. Originally, patient was
going to be discharged after receiving chemotherapy and IVIG for
her neurologic disorder, but had developed febrile neutropenia.
While receiving her course of antibiotics
(Cefepime/Vancomycin/Metronidazole) for the neutropenia, she
developed headaches in the setting of thrombocytopenia (Plt
count 16). On [**2102-7-12**], due to concern for intracranial
hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, patient was ordered
for transfusion. Halfway through the transfusion, patient
experienced desaturation and transfusion was stopped and labs
for transfusion reaction were sent. Chest x-ray at that time
demonstrated interstitial infiltrates. The patient was managed
supportively with oxygen, and no diuretics were given at the
time. After midnight on [**7-13**], patient began experiencing
increasing oxygen requirement and received 10mg IV furosemide,
with a 300cc diuresis, and some improvement in her respiratory
status. Later that morning, patient again became increasingly
hypoxic, requiring 5 litres nasal cannula, and received 10mg IV
furosemide with 600cc diuresis and no significant improvement in
oxygen requirement. She remained asymptomatic during this
period, other than small amounts of hemoptysis. At 8PM on [**7-14**],
patient became febrile to 102 and tachycardic (while on
Vancomycin [**7-3**], Cefepime [**7-5**], and metronidazole [**7-8**]),
appeared dehydrated, and received 750cc IV fluids.
.
At 1:30AM on [**7-14**], the patient triggered for desaturation to
80s% with mental status changes. Oxygenation improved to mid-90%
on non-rebreather. Blood gas showed 7.39/41/53 presumably while
on 5 litres nasal cannula. She received 10mg IV furosemide with
1 litre diuresis. On morning of ICU transfer, she continued to
remain tachycardic, with oxygen requirement of 70% facemask,
saturating in high 90s. She continued to have hemoptysis with
progressively worsening anemia, with a hematocrit of 22.
Transfusion then was considered but was deferred due to unclear
volume status, and question of possible TRALI with prior
platelet transfusion. Due to persistent hypoxia, diagnosis of PE
was entertained, although thought unlikely as patient had been
on low-dose fondaparinux for prophylaxis. CTA was deferred, but
bilateral LENIs, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram were ordered.
Patient complained of some jaw discomfort similar to her chronic
angina, relieved with nitroglycerin earlier that morning. ECG
showed sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm, normal axis and intervals,
normal QRS norphology, no specific ST or T-wave changes. CXR on
transfer showed increased bilateral parenchymal interstitial
markings, evolving left peri-hilar opacification, and persistent
right-lower perihilar infiltrate, with no effusions.
.
Pt continued to be hypoxic, requiring nasal cannula and face
tent,and continued to be hypotensive as well. An infectious
work-up was initiated to evaluate further for an additional
etiology for her symptoms, in addition to the SCLC. However, on
[**7-15**] family decided that at this point it would be best for her
to be made CMO. She was made comfortable on a morphine drip, and
was discharged to home with hospice services.

Details below pertain to her hospitalization prior to transfer
to the ICU:

# Metastatic Ca of unknown primary and cervical subcutaneous
soft tissue mass consistent with small cell lung cancer
metastasis: Patient received carboplatin and etoposide.

# Fever - On HD#4 patient spiked a fever to 101.5.  She was
asymptomatic, with exception of scant wheezes throughout.  She
was pancultured with negative UCx, negative Legionella Ag in
urine, and BCx pending to date.  WBC increased to 28K.  Although
temporally this was associated with Filgastrim, due to high risk
of infection, patient was treated for HAP: started on Vancomycin
(4), Levofloxacin(2d), then switched to Cefepime (2d) for
pseudomonal coverage (days of AB on day of discharge)  to be
most likely [**1-21**].  Pt was continued on ipratropium nebulizers q6h
daily. CXR from HD# 6 revealed a new left perihilar opacity,
suggestive of PNA in comparison to CXR from [**5-30**]. Pt was now
with productive cough of brown dark sputum. Sputum Cx showed
GPCs and GNRs.  By HD#8, the WBC count had dropped to 6K as part
of a pancytopenic response to the chemotherapy.

# Pain control - Oxycontin was increased to 60 Q8h and oxycodone
for breakthrough at 5mg q4h prn and gabapentin 300 mg [**Hospital1 **].  By
HD#3, patient reported significant improvement in pain, [**5-30**].
This pain was described as soreness and improved with frequent
patient repositioning to [**1-29**].  With PT and movement from OOB to
chair, patient's pain had dissipated by HD#5 and she did not
require prn oxycodone by HD#6.  She continued to receive
oxycontin 60mg TID.

# Lower extremity weakness/numbness - most likely [**1-21**] a
paraneoplastic syndrome.  Pt was status post IVIG during last
admission.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1206**] of neurology was consulted and a
recommendation was made to readminister an IVIG regimen x5d at
0.4g/kg/day of IVIG x 5 days.  This was started on HD#5 and
completed on HD#10.  Initially there was mild improvement in
motor function of LE (4+/5 strength with flex/ext of feet b/l,
2+/5 proximally b/l) and decrease in numbness improved in LE and
paresthesias in UE. It was difficult to delineate the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] of
change as multiple interventions were performed in parallel
(chemo/IVIG).  It was considered that no benefit was obtained
from the Dexamethasone 1mg QD dosing.  A taper of 1mg to 0.5mg
qd for 5 days was initiated on [**7-5**] to be changed to prednisone
0.5mg EOD by [**7-10**] and completed by [**7-17**].

# CAD - ASA was continued at 162mg daily as were her statin,
b-blocker, nitrates and ACE-I. Nitrates changed to PM dose as
transient episode of hypotension in AM on [**2102-7-1**] (HD#3).
.
# PVD - patient was continued on plavix, statin and aspirin. No
acute issues. Admission ECG consistent with baseline.
.
# COPD - Patient was continued on nebs q6h.
.
#FEN - Patient on regular diet as tolerated.
.
#Access - PICC was placed.
.
#PPX - Fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis.
.
#Code - DNR/DNI

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old male with
history of diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease and
metastatic renal cell cancer who underwent a thoracotomy with
biopsy in [**2144-2-23**].  He was treated with a vaccine for
renal cell carcinoma at that time.  The patient now presents
with a large left hilar mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for right nephrectomy in
[**2125**] for renal cell cancer, he is diabetic, gastroesophageal
reflux disease as well as depression.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy, right knee surgery in [**2136**],
right nephrectomy in [**2135**] and a right flank mass excision in
[**2137**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. q day.
2.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day.
3.  Amaril 2 mg half tab p.o. q Am.
4.  Ambien 5 mg p.o. q h.s.

ALLERGIES:  Contrast dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation was noted for neck
supple, there was no lymphadenopathy.  His lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  He had an
old right nephrectomy incision subcostal margin that was well
healed.  Extremities showed no evidence of edema.

He had admission labs with white count 7,000, hematocrit of
25.8, platelet count 619, coagulation profile 12.  PT/INR
1.1, PTT 28, albumin 3.4.  Chemistries within normal limits
with a normal BUN and creatinine.

He was therefore, taken to the operating room on [**2144-10-26**]
where he underwent a radical pneumonectomy with an
inter-pericardial approach.  After that time the patient was
sent to the Intensive Care Unit for postoperative care.  On
postoperative day 0 the patient was doing well, his
cardiovascular profile was being supported with
Neo-Synephrine drip.  His urine output was noted to be
somewhat decreased, he was started on Digoxin for atrial
fibrillation prophylaxis.  His postop hematocrit was 25 and
he was therefore transfused a unit of blood with low urine
output although his preoperative crit was also 25.  Post
transfusion crit subsequently came back at 32 and he did have
inappropriate response to urine output.  Preoperative heart
rate was noted to be 104 and sinus tach with no ischemic
changes.  No strain pattern.

Postoperatively he was persistently tachy between 104 to 117.
All of the parameters for pain, anxiety, hypoxia, hypercarbia
were all optimized to eliminate the possible underlying
[**Doctor Last Name 360**].

The patient was maintained on epidural as well as had a Foley
catheter to gravity.  By postop day one he was doing well,
Neo-Synephrine was weaned, Digoxin was maintained for
prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation.  He was given chest
physical therapy, incentive spirometry and his chest tube was
to suction.  He was transferred to the floor subsequent to
that and put on Protonics for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
He was started on a sliding scale, Amaril as started on
postoperative day two, his creatinine was noted to rise to
about 1.4 from a baseline of 1.  Urine output was marginal
however, given an intermittent bolus of normal saline he
responded appropriately.

By postoperative day two the patient had a chest tube
removed, he had no pneumothorax by postop chest x-ray.  There
was no air fluid level on the left chest.  The right chest
was well expanded with no pneumo as previously stated, there
was some basilar atelectasis noted however, no effusion.

The patient continued aggressive pulmonary toilet including
incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing and
nebulizer treatments p.r.n. with the respiratory therapy
service and early mobilization with good pain control.

By postop day three the patient had his epidural removed,
Foley catheter taken out, he was started on oral analgesics
with Percocet as needed.  He was ambulatory and afebrile.

On postop day four the patient's post transfusion crit was
recorded as 28 and stable, therefore, he was deemed
appropriate for discharge at this time.  He will be sent home
on the following discharge medications:  He will resume all
of his preop meds as well as addition of Percocet 5/325 mg
one to two tabs p.o. q 4 hours as needed.  Lopressor 12.5 mg
q b.i.d., He will also be on a stool softener, Colace 100 mg
b.i.d. as well as Percocet.  He will continue his Amaril,
Ambien an Paxil as well as Prilosec as previously stated.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  Afebrile.  Sating at 96%
His exam is noted for a well approximated incision with no
staples, no erythema or exudate across the left hemithorax.
The right chest was clear to auscultation with occasional
crackles at the base.  Heart was regular and his extremities
had no edema, warm and well perfused.

DISCHARGE STATUS: To go to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
2.  Status post radical left pneumonectomy with
    inter-pericardial approach for a large left hilar
    mass.  Final pathology is pending at time of discharge.

The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in the clinic one week from
discharge.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48 year old male with
adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus.  He underwent
neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and radiation.  He
completed chemotherapy four weeks prior to admission and
radiation therapy two weeks prior to admission.  The patient
had a significant weight loss of approximately 30 pounds.

CT scan per Oncology demonstrated partial resolution of the
tumor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Nephrolithiasis in [**2172**].
2.  Chronic low back pain.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  J-tube placement.
2.  Porta-Cath placement.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, vital signs stable.  HEENT:
No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2194-11-17**], where he went to the Operating Room and had an
esophagogastrectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection.
Postoperatively, the patient had a mild episode of
hypotension which was attributed to the epidural catheter.
The patient was doing well until he became febrile on
[**2194-11-20**].  On [**11-21**], some wound drainage was
seen from the abdominal incision.  A CT scan was obtained
after several days of monitoring the drainage and the scan
revealed a wound dehiscence.

The patient went to the Operating Room on [**11-25**], for
debridement of fascia and a buttress repair of the wound
dehiscence.  Postoperatively, the patient had hypotension and
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

On [**11-29**], the patient had an episode of tachycardias in
to the 160s. Copious amounts of green drainage was seen from
the right chest tube.  Another chest tube was placed which
revealed also copious amounts of drainage.  The patient was
placed on multiple pressors and was intubated.

On [**11-30**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room
again for esophageal diversion of his split fistula.
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained and he was
placed on Imipenem, Vancomycin, Fluconazole, Levofloxacin,
for multiple organisms.  He was started on total parenteral
nutrition.

On [**12-2**], the patient grew out Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum.  Gradually, in the
Intensive Care Unit his pressors were weaned.  Tube feeds
were started on [**12-5**].  A follow-up chest CT scan was
obtained which revealed a small right fluid collection which
was significantly improved from the prior.

Tube feeds were advanced to goal and the TPN was discontinued

Date of Birth:   [**2056-10-30**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 61-year-old male with
metastatic renal carcinoma status post multiple rigid bronchs
for multiple pulmonary metastases.  The patient came today
the OR at the procedure and was subsequently extubated, but
remained hypoxic on O2 sats at about 82%.  He remained
agitated, confused, diaphoretic, and required reintubation.

Of note, the patient has had one more complication in the
past requiring reintubation.

1. Renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2115-3-5**] status
post right nephrectomy.
2. Excision of the right atrium as well as multiple pulmonary
metastases.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3. Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
2. Norvasc 10 q day.
3. Terazosin 10 [**Hospital1 **].
4. Glucotrol 20 q day.
5. Tylenol.
6. Ativan.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, consultant, former smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile, heart rate 100, blood
pressure 100/50, sedated and intubated.  No jugular venous
distention.  Tachycardic, S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lung examination:  Coarse breath sounds with
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel
sounds, no edema, [**2-3**]+ pulses.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further observation of respiratory
distress.  On hospital day #2, the patient underwent
bronchoscopy which revealed multiple hemorrhagic metastases
extending through the large portion of the bronchial tree.

At this point, a discussion with the family was initiated with
the presence of medical oncology, interventional pulmonology and
critical care.  As there were no more therapeutic options
available from an oncologic or airway standpoint, all were in
agreement that it would be in the best interest for
the patient to pursue a nonaggressive approach.  Therefore,
the patient was made comfort measures only, and was started
on a Morphine drip.  He expired the same day in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

hemi-arthroplasty being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia in
the setting of recurrent atrial tachycardia. He was admitted
[**11-16**] for a right hemi-arthroplasty for an impending
pathological right femoral neck fracture, developed atrial
tachycardia pre-operatively that was unresponsive to esmolol and
amiodarone (it was controlled by dilt-gtt), and he was
,therefore, cardioverted in the OR ([**2112-11-16**]). His amiodarone
dose has been increased (200-->300). He was transferred from the
SICU to the medicine floor [**2112-11-20**]. He has been diuresed since
[**11-19**] for volume overload (20mg iv lasix) with good response.
Last night a trigger was called for pulse 140s-150s, that
responded to IV metoprolol (5mg x2). Tonight another trigger was
called for tachycardia to 150s and hypoxia (sats to 75% on 4l
which he had required since extubation). He was treated with 5
mg metoprolol IV and developed hypotension (sbp to 80s). At the
time of evaluation, he was tachypneic with R 30s up from 20,
pulse down to 80s, and BP 100/58.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23952**] is a 59 yo M w/ h/o metastatic lung cancer, s/p renal
transplant on predisone, h/o CAD s/p CABG, and h/o SVT s/p CV
this admission who was admitted [**11-16**] for right
hemi-arthroplasty following a pathologic fracture. Patient was
transferred to the MICU on the evening of [**2112-11-22**] for
hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Patient was initially
tried on BIPAP but upon return of worsening labs, poor
improvement in oxygenation, and lack of response to lasix,
patient was intubated for aggressive management of presumed
sepsis. Following intubation, patient's sats continued to fall.
Bronchoscopy was performed but minimal secretions were obtained,
all airways were patent, and the ETT was confirmed to be in
appropriate positioning. Following this intervention, patient's
sats improved and repeat ABG w/ PaO2 64->183. However, patient
was requiring high dose levo, neo, and vasopressin to maintain
MAP 60. In addition, course c/b recurrent atrial tachycardia
controlled w/ an esmolol gtt. Lab called re: blood cx positive
for GNR from [**11-21**]. Patient's family arrived at this point and
discussion was initiated re: clarification of code status (per
NF and notes, patient documented to be full code). Wife clearly
and deliberately stated patient wished to be DNR. When asked re:
intubation, wife stated they had not discussed that. Family
informed that Mr. [**Known lastname 23952**] was critically ill and pressor
dependent and requiring high ventilatory support; if support
d/c, patient would likely die. Family requested a moment and
then approached me re: d/c of all support. ICU attending made
aware of family's wishes. Patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
also made aware and reiterated patient's short life expectancy
(likely, months). Wife and sister at the bedside and were
offered continued care to see how things go but that the
decision was ultimately theirs to decide what [**Doctor First Name **] would want.
Wife and sister agreed [**Name (NI) **] would not want continued ICU support
to sustain his life. They requested all care be discontinued.
Pressors and esmolol gtt d/c and ventilator adjusted to provide
23% FiO2 w/o PEEP or PS. Patient expired within 5 minutes.
Family declined an autopsy. PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], and oncologist
emailed. ICU and floor attending notified by page

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with a history of stage
IIIA NSCLC s/p lobectomy, radiation, chemotherapy [**10-20**] and
remote history of breast cancer as well as worsening chronic SOB
who presented to outpatient hem/onc clinic on [**2-24**] with worsening
SOB.
.
Since [**2134-6-17**] she has had progressive dyspnea and has seen Dr.

[**Doctor Last Name 2168**] to w/u this process (per husband, breathing has not
been the same since lobectomy). And has had a bronch [**8-/2134**]
negative for malignancy; + atypical cells suggestive of post-XRT
change however; Cx + for MAC (grew out after 1 month). She has
not undergone any therapy for this. She developed SOB and
pleuritic chest pain in middle of [**Month (only) 1096**] and was admitted from
[**Date range (1) 104003**] and found to have a large pericardial effusion which
required emergent pericardiocentesis.  Cytology did not show
malignant cells and stains for AFB, viral, fungal, bacterial,
gram stain were all negative (2+ PMNs).  Her SOB greatly
improved and she was treated with azithro and cefpodoxime for
RUL opacities on admission CT and history of MAC (dx [**2134**], never
treated, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] as outpt) for a total of 7
days, as well as oxygen and nebs at home.  Since the patient was
discharged from the hospital she has been SOB at rest with very
limited ambulation and on O2 at all times.  2 weeks ago went to
OSH ED with SOB and was diagnosed with pericarditis, unclear
treatment.  1 week prior to admission patient was more somnolent
and taking ativan regularly in an attempt to treat worsening
SOB.  She went to [**Hospital3 **] ED two days PTA where she was found
to be 84% on ambulation.  CXR was done which showed RML opacity
and bilateral effusions. She was discharged home on doxycylcine
but represented to [**Hospital1 18**] for second opinion.  She was seen in
clinic and d/t respiratory distress was had CT of chest which
showed new PNA in RUL and increasing bilateral effusions.  She
initially came to the floor and ABG demonstrated chronic
respiratory acidosis with compensation.  Serial ABG's showed
worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia, she become more somnolent,
and was transferred to MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the OMED service from clinic for further
work-up and care. On presentation, the pt was extremely
somnolent and was noted to be sating in the low 90s on 4L NC. An
ABG was significant for a significant respiratory acidosis with
compensatory metabolic alkalosis that appeared to be more
chronic in nature. Given the history of the pt taking Ativan
everytime she felt short of breath since her prior admission,
this was thought to be the primary cause of her respiratory
acidosis, especially as the pt was not tachypneic on physical
exam. She was placed on IV vancomycin, cefepime, and
azithromycin to broadly cover for a nosocomial PNA that was
visualized on CXR and CT on admission. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight on hospital day 1 given concern for
increasing somnolence and PCO2. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ativan was held and
the pt's mental status improved back to baseline. She also
underwent a L thoracocentesis that was not significant for an
empyema and cytology was negative for malignant cells. Her O2
requirement was weaned from 6L to 4 L and she was then
transferred back to the floor where she completed a 10 day
course of IV vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. She was
also placed on standing nebs and started on an ipratropium
inhaler. It was thought that the pt's SOB on presentation was
likely multi-factorial including chronic issues of radiation
changes, lobectomy, restrictive disease on PFTs, and possibly
cancer.  More acute worsening was though to be due to her
bilateral effusions and PNA.  Chronic hypoventilation in setting
of overuse of benzos was also a large contributor to the chronic
respiratory acidosis with a degree of compensation as well as
more acute metabolic alkalosis d/t dehydration. The pt does have
a known h/o MAC, but this is longstanding and not thought to be
a contributor.  Although PE was on the differential, this was
thought to be unlikely as she was on anti-coagulation for PAF as
an outpt.
.
During the hospital course, it was also noted that the pt would
go in and out of a-fib. Her coumadin was initially held on
presentation due to a supratherapeutic INR but was restarted
once she was transferred back to the floor. Her toprol was
changed to tid metoprolol dosing and titrated up to 125 mg for
rate control. Diltiazem 30 mg qid was also added for increased
rate control with good effect. Prior to discharge, the pt was
also diuresed a total of 3L for fluid overload noted on
examination. She was discharged home to complete an additional 5
day course of po azithromycin and cefpodoxime. She will f/u with
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-19**] days for a general check-up and to check her CBC
and INR. She will also f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
4 weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for shortness of breath and were found to have
a pneumonia and were not breathing well secondary to
overmedication with ativan.

You will need to take an additional 5 day course of antibiotics
at home on top of the IV antibiotics that you received in the
hospital.

Please take all medications as prescribed. You were started on
several new medications, including Remeron for anxiety, and
Diltiazem for heart rate control. Rather than taking Toprol once
daily at home, this was changed to Metoprolol 125 mg three times
a day.

It is very important to not take too much ativan as this may
depress your respiratory drive. Please take only 0.5 mg every 6
hours as needed for anxiety.


Followup Instructions:
Please call your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 104004**], to follow-up on either Tuesday
or Wednesday. You will need to have the following blood work
checked: CBC and INR in addition to a regular check-up.

Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 4 weeks. Call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 514**] to make an appointment.

GUIDANCE FOR [**Female First Name (un) **]/ABD/PARA CE; PLEURAL ASP BY RADIOLOGIST
Reason: RT PLEURAL EFFUSION
INDICATION: Right-sided pleural effusion.
PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] and supervising.  Under ultrasound guidance, a 19-gauge
[**Last Name (un) 11097**] catheter was inserted into a pocket of fluid in the right
pleural space without difficulty. 2 to 3 cc of clear
serous-appearing fluid was withdrawn. This fluid was sent for
the requested Gram stain and culture. The patient tolerated the
procedure well with no immediate post-procedure complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic thoracentesis on the right.
The patient will return for a CT-guided pleural drainage
catheter placement on Friday, [**2157-2-25**].
These findings were discussed with the ordering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

CLINICAL HISTORY: Lung cancer status post right lower lobe wedge
resection. Now worsening right pleural effusion. Evaluate for PE
or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism as clinically questioned.
2. Complete atelectasis of the right middle lobe. There is a
moderate right pleural effusion with no evidence of infection on
CT.
3. Abnormal mediastinal and hilar soft tissue. This may be
related to postsurgical changes.
4. Left breast mass again noted. Correlate with mammography.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
61 year old woman with right lower lobe mass s/p lobectomy s/p
bronch
INDICATION: Right lower lobe mass, status post lobectomy, status
post bronchoscopy.
FINDINGS: Again seen is opacification of the inferior right
hemithorax, status post right lower lobe resection. Unchanged
opacity obliterating the right heart border corresponds with
persistent collapse of the right middle lobe. The aerated
portion of the right lung remains unchanged, and the left
hemithorax remains within normal limits. While the right border
of the heart is obscured, the left border is unchanged. No
evidence of pneumothorax or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right middle lobe collapse.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2157-2-18**] 8:03 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old woman with known right lower lung mass s/p right
VATS
INDICATION: Known right lower lung mass status post VATS.
Evaluate for right effusion.
FINDINGS: There is persistent collapse of the right middle lobe,
with small right-sided pleural effusion. The aerated portion of
the right hemithorax as well as the left hemithorax appears
normal without evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. The
visualized portions of the cardiac silhouette and mediastinum
are within normal limits. No osseous abnormalities appreciated.
IMPRESSION: Persistent collapse of the right middle lobe. Based
on the results of the recent (postoperative) bronchoscopy, this
is presumably due to postobstructive collapse due to secretions.

PORTABLE AP CHEST:
There is no change from prior radiograph obtained yesterday.
Right effusion persists. There is no pneumothorax. The left lung
field is clear. The right IJ catheter and the right-sided chest
tubes are in good position.
IMPRESSION: Persistent right effusion with chest tubes in place.
No pneumothorax.

PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2157-2-13**].
COMPARISON: [**2157-2-12**].
INDICATION: Dropping blood pressure. Status post lobectomy.
Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax. A
previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is no longer
visualized. Postoperative volume loss is again demonstrated in
the right hemithorax. The right hemidiaphragm has a change in
configuration compared to the earliest postoperative radiograph
on [**2157-2-11**], suggesting a component of superimposed
subpulmonic pleural fluid in this region. This is not
appreciably changed since the more recent radiograph. A
unilateral interstitial pattern in the right lung appears
increased and may reflect interstitial pulmonary edema.
Subcutaneous emphysema is again seen in the right chest wall.

Respiratory difficulty due to tumor impingment on L main
bronchus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and debridement of tumor impinging on L bronchus.


History of Present Illness:
74yo F with non-small cell Lung CA diagnosed in [**2097**] (stage 3b),
presented for bronchoscopy, photodynamic therapy, and
debridement of L bronchus on [**8-29**] by interventional pulmonary
service. The procedure cleared the LLL & LUL but the lingula
remained obstructed at the end of the procedure.  In the PACU,
the pt became tachpneic with decreased breath sounds on left,
increased airway pressures, peak=32 with plateau=27. CXR
demonstrated complete opacification of the L lung without
midline shift.  She was subsequently bronched in the PACU with
suctioning of a mucous plug from the L bronchus - showed
improvement in pt's breath sounds on L, peak pressure now 24,
CXR with improved ventilation of L lung. She was then
transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Pulmonary - Oxygen sat's, respiratory rate, and peak pressures
were monitored closely for indication of recurrent obstruction.
Repeat bronch by IP [**9-1**] showed edematous airways.  It was felt
to be difficult to extubate the patient given edematous airways
and aggressive diuresis was begun. On [**9-3**] the RISBI was 73 and
the patient strongly desired the tube out; the patient was
extubated on [**2103-9-3**]. After extubation, she began to experience
respiratory difficulty and required support. She was clear in
her wishes to not be reintubated, and was begun on bipap and
then on cpap overnight. Morphine was administered to ease her
breathing.

2)A-fib/AVR - Coumadin was held until after procedures. IV
heparin was restarted [**9-1**], and coumadin was restarted [**2103-9-3**].

3)DM - The patient was covered with sliding scale insulin. The
plan was to resume OP meds when extubated & taking PO meals. She
did not take PO meals while hospitalized.

4)FEN - The patient was kept NPO. She was offered an NGT to
begin tube feeds, but given her daily reevaluation for
extubation, she preferred not to begin tube feeds. She received
maintainence fluids while not taking PO's.
She was noted to have an increasing anion gap acidosis, perhaps
due to starvation ketosis.

5)Oliguria after second bronch in PACU. Received fluid boluses
but did not respond with increased urine output. On [**9-2**]
oliguria improved, questionably due to position of Foley
catheter. She put out approximately 500cc with each dose of 20
IV lasix.

6)ID - Low grade temp on [**2103-9-3**]. Urine, blood, sputum cultures
still pending but no growth to date at time of discharge.

7)Prophylaxis - Protonix, SQ Heparin, pneumoboots, SS Insulin,
Chlorhexidine.

8)Access - 2 peripheral IV's, Foley catheter.

9)Communication - Husband & daughters

10)Status - DNR/DNI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 74-year-old lady with past
medical history significant for breast cancer, status post a
right mastectomy in the year [**2114**], status post a VATS
procedure, mediastinoscopy, multiple bronchoscopies who ruled
in for an MI during this hospitalization which led to the
discovery of two vessel disease and a stent placement at
cardiac catheterization.  Status post left upper lobectomy
and mediastinal lymph node excision on [**2116-10-6**] for a left
sided lung mass.  She is PPD negative.  She has had a
complicated medical course since her admission the day of
surgery, marked by respiratory decompensation due to mucus
plugging, pseudomonas and Klebsiella pneumonia, MRSA
pneumonia, also has had atrial fibrillation, C. difficile
colitis, ischemic colitis by colonoscopy, CMV colitis by
colonoscopy, pathology results treated with Ganciclovir.  She
had a colonoscopy on [**2116-10-29**].  She has had a very complicated
respiratory status course which includes high oxygen
requirements, aggressive pulmonary toilet, multiple
bronchoscopies, a prolonged antibiotic course including
Ceftazidime, Levaquin and had had her hospital course
complicated as well by maroon colored guaiac positive stools.
The patient initially on postoperative day #1 was extubated,
transferred from the PACU to the patient floor and then
eventually, 14 days into her hospitalization, was sent to the
Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure requiring
intubation.  Since then patient has been unable to wean
completely from ventilator and subsequently had a
tracheostomy placed.  The patient had a full course of Flagyl
for C. difficile colitis.  The patient has had a presumed
partial small bowel obstruction.  She has had multiple
surgical consults and follow-ups and abdominal CT which
showed a gallstone, somewhat abnormal gallbladder but not
frank cholecystitis as well as some dilated loops of
intestine with no specific bowel obstruction.  The patient
has had a very difficult time tolerating enteral feeding and
currently is undergoing hyperalimentation through a PICC
central line.  The patient has had multiple episodes of
hypotension and has had a prolonged course of alpha agonist
pressor requirements, presumably in the setting of bacteremia
and sepsis, likely secondary to her courses with pneumonia.
The patient also has been seen by speech and swallow and had
a Passy-Muir valve placed and was able to phonate.  The
patient has been followed by the infectious disease
specialist, by the cardiologist, general surgery, thoracic
surgery and Intensive Care Unit team as well as the GI
consult service.  The patient was noted to have a drop in her
platelets, Heparin induced antiplatelets antibodies were sent
and were positive and the patient has a diagnosis of Heparin
induced thrombocytopenia.  The patient also was noted to have
drop in her hematocrit with maroon colored stool and a CT
scan with possible ischemic bowel but no progression and no
worsening and was not operated on, was just followed
clinically.  Then subsequently patient was also found to have
a CMV colitis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient currently in stable
condition, awaiting rehab placement.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  As listed above.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with her primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**] at [**Hospital1 190**].  Case worker there should call Dr.[**Name (NI) 14732**]

Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, Hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 48 y/o F w/recent diagnosis of metastatic lung ca (R apical
lung mass, trapezius muscle, liver, adrenals, left paraspinal
muscle, C2 vertebrae, brain) who came here from XRT today after
feeling dizzy. She was recently admitted from [**Date range (2) 110025**]
where all of this was recently diagnosed. At that time she began
palliative XRT to her thorax and had stents to her trachea,
bronchus intermedius, and left mainstem. She was discharged to
home on [**3-29**] with plans to continue XRT. However, per her
husband, today she came to the [**Name (NI) **] c/o dizziness for the last 2
days. Chronic SOB but nothing acute, and denied all other
complaints per ED notes.
*
In the ED, she was tachycardic in the 110s-130s, hypotensive in
the 60s-70s/40s, and hypoxic to 82% on an unclear amt of oxygen.
Pulsus 9. She was given 4 L IVF and levophed, and a central line
was placed. She also received decadron, vanc/levo/flagyl, and
ativan. CTA was negative for PE and showed a large mediastinal
mass. They planned on intubating her, but at that point social
work met with the patient and she decided to be CMO. She was
transferred to the CCU on a morphine gtt.

Gen: breathing heavily, asleep
Neck: R IJ TLC in place
Lungs: rhonchorous anteriorly
CV: tachycardic, no murmur
Abd: nondistended

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Lordotic positioning. A right IJ line is present, new
compared with [**2182-3-28**]. The tip overlies the expected site of the
SVC/RA junction. Rightward displacement of the line is thought
to reflect the presence of the large mediastinal mass displacing
the SVC. Again seen is dense opacification of the right upper
and medial midzones, somewhat denser on the current examination.
There is also increased retrocardiac density, essentially
unchanged. Increased opacity above the aortic knob likely
reflects the patient's mediastinal mass and is unchanged. Again
noted are the lower tracheal and right bronchial stents. No
left-sided effusion is identified. No CHF is detected. No
pneumothorax is identified.
*
Chest CT:
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Again seen is a large right mediastinal mass not
significantly changed
 from prior study.  There has been interval stenting of the
trachea and main stem bronchi.  The aorta, SVC, and IVC appear
patent.
 2.  Interval increase in right upper lobe
atelectasis/consolidation of fluid.  Large right pleural
effusion again seen.  Multiple pulmonary metastases again
identified.
 3.  Left upper back metastasis and adrenal masses again seen.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
white male noted to have slight increased shortness of breath
two months prior to admission and the patient is status post
chest CT showing right lower lobe 4 cm lesion.  Associated
sputum was clear.  The patient was without fevers or chills,
without fatigue, and weight was stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Coronary artery
disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1. Right middle lobe resection two
years prior.  2. Coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2124**].  3.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was afebrile
at 97.1 with a heart rate of 69, blood pressure 142/70 and
oxygen saturation 98%.  The patient was in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact.  Neck:
Supple without lymphadenopathy, without jugular venous
distension.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs, gallops, or rubs; S1 and S2 were normal.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Genitourinary:  Positive for
some injection.

LABORATORY DATA:  CT of the chest on [**2130-6-7**] showed a 3 x 4
cm lung mass.  Laboratory studies on [**2130-6-7**] showed a BUN of
23, creatinine 1.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2130-8-1**] with diagnosis of right lower lobe tumor and
underwent:  1. Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
2. Right open wedge resection under general anesthesia.
Seven hundred of crystalloid was given, 250 urine output was
recorded.  Condition was recorded as stable with an estimated
blood loss of 50 cc.  The right lower lobe wedge was sent for
pathology specimen.

Immediately postoperatively the patient was reintubated in
the operating room secondary to respiratory acidemia, with
marginal blood pressures requiring some pressors and positive
for fluid.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day
one with saturation rates of 98%.

On postoperative day two the patient was transferred to the

hospital course progressed until the patient was discharged
on saturations of 90% on room air and 97-98% on three to four
liters.

Physical therapy cleared the patient as capable of going home
on postoperative day number two.  The patient was discharged
on postoperative day three without event.

ADDENDUM:  The patient was deemed unready to be discharged
home by physical therapy and it was felt by physical therapy
that the patient would benefit from one or two more days in
the hospital to monitor saturation rate.  So, the patient was
discharged on [**2130-8-6**], when oxygen saturation
rates were increased a bit, yet still below 88% requiring

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**2157-12-19**]: The pre-existing opacity at the right lung base is
smaller than on the previous examination. Areas of right basal
atelectasis have clearly decreased in size. Overall, the right
lung appears much better ventilated than before.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild decrease in
extent of
pre-existing left lower lobe atelectasis. No newly appeared
parenchymal
opacities. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.

Chest X-ray    [**2158-12-16**]
Impression:
Two views. Comparison with the previous study done on [**2158-12-15**].
Bibasilar
consolidation, more pronounced on the right and right pleural
fluid and/or
thickening persists. A very small right apical pneumothorax is
redemonstrated. There is streaky density at the bases consistent
with
subsegmental atelectasis as before. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged. The bony thorax is grossly intact.

Chest X-ray    [**2158-12-15**]
Impression:
There is interval increase in right pleural effusion. There is
small amount of right apical pneumothorax better appreciated on
the current view and seen at the apex and along the mediastinum.
The loculation of the air in the basal pleura is also seen.
Mediastinum is at the central position. Left lung is essentially
clear except for minimal basal atelectasis. Calcifications
surrounding the right humeral head most likely located within
the joint are redemonstrated and most likely consistent with
synovial osteochondromatosis.

CT chest scan  [**2158-12-15**]
Impression:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Loculated right hydropneumothorax status post right lower
lobe superior
segmentectomy.
3. 2.9 cm low-density collection with multiple foci of air noted
within the
subcarinal space. Given its location, these findings likely
represent the
sequelae of mediastinal lymph node biopsy. However, differential
diagnosis
includes abscess. If the patient is stable, a followup chest CT
in three
months is recommended for further evaluation. If the patient is
not stable, a
repeat study may be obtained in one week for further assessment.

4. Bibasilar consolidations with marked secretions within the
right bronchus
intermedius and basal segmental bronchi. Findings are concerning
for
aspiration and atelectasis. However, superimposed infection
cannot be
excluded.
5. Mild enlargement of the mediastinal and right hilar lymph
nodes, possibly
reactive in nature.
5. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, consistent with
pulmonary artery
hypertension.

ECHO [**2158-12-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2158-12-12**] where he underwent VATS converted to open right
thoracotomy RLL superior segmentectomy for a right lower lung
FDG avid lung nodule. The patient was kept intubated overnight
in the ICU. POD 1 he was extubated. An epidural was placed by
acute pain service which was discontinued POD 2. The following
is a systems review of the hospital course:

Neuro: The patient remained neurologically intact throughout his
stay. He was sedated initially on propofol while intubated, then
received paravertebral block with bupivacaine, along with IV
Dilaudid. This was dc'd POD 1, and the patients pain was
controlled well with ibuprofen, Tylenol and oxycodone.

Pulmonary: Aggressive pulmonary toilet was encouraged. The chest
tube was on wall suction, then to water seal POD 2, then dc'd
POD 3. His oxygen requirements increased. A CTA was done on
[**2158-12-15**] to rule out PE given rapid fib and need for oxygen. This
was negative for PE, but revealed a pneumonia process.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs and incentive
spirometer were continued.  Oxygen saturations were 77-83% on
room air, with ambulation, 93-95% on Liters via nasal cannula.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable until the eve of
POD 2, at which time he went into rapid fib which was not
converted after Lopressor 5mg IV x 2 and diltiazem 10mg IV push
and 10mg/hr gtt. Cardiology consulted [**2158-12-15**] am, and
recommended amiodarone, and echo (see report). Amiodarone 150mg
IV bolus and gtt started, and the pt cardioverted around 1500 to
NSR.  He was converted to PO amiodarone 200 mg daily. On
[**2157-12-18**] while ambulating he had another episode of Afib 140's
which converted to SR with IV Lopressor and PO Lopressor was
started.  He was seen by cardiology again who recommended
increasing his Amiodarone to 400 mg daily and stopping toprol
and home with an event monitor.
Dishcarge heart rhythm sinus 60-70. Blood pressure stable
100-120.

ABD: Diet advanced and tolerated. Stool softeners given.

GU: Foley was placed intra op and dc'd after paravertebral block
dc'd on POD 2. He voided small frequent amounts. A bladder scan
revealed 800 residual therefore a  A  Foley was placed.  His
home BPH medications were restarted the Foley was removed 24
hours later and he voided large amount without difficulty.  POD
3 he was gently diuresed.  His renal function remain within
normal limits.

Heme: Warfarin was started 5 mg [**2158-12-19**] for atrial fibrillation
INR Goal 2.0-3.0 then 2 mg daily since on amiodarone and
levofloxacin.  PT/INR on Friday with VNA and call or fax results
to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**].

Endocrine: fingerstick blood sugars remained less than 200.

ID: Vancomycin and Zosyn started empirically for a pneumonia
seen on CT. Sputum cultures were unable to be obtained during
his hospitalization and he was switched to Levaquin to
empirically treat his pneumonia.

Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ and SCD's placed for VTE prophylaxis.

Dispo: The patient was evaluated by PT who recommended home with
services for pulmonary rehab. He continue to make steady
progress and was discharge to home on [**2158-12-19**] with his family,
VNA, home oxygen and PT.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] as an outpatient.

1) Subclavian Thrombus - Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with symptoms of R
arm swelling, increased vascular markings on his R arm, and
neck/upper back pain. These symptoms were similiar to symptoms
he had at the time of his cancer diagnosis when he had SVC
syndrome. On admission, he had a CT scan of his chest and upper
abdomen which showed stable changes in the right paratracheal
and right subcarinal regions, a slightly increased right pleural
effusion with minimal pericardial effusion, and a filling defect
in the SVC with a patent left subclavian stent. CT scan of the
head showed no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. Pt
went to IR to have angioplasty of the R brachiocephalic and
subclavian stents and restenting performed. The angioplasty was
performed without any complications, tPA was infused, and the
patient came to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post-procedure for monitoring. He was
placed on a heparin gtt overnight for bridging back to Lovenox.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate change in R subclavian thrombus
INDICATION: 42-year-old man with history of adenocarcinoma of
the lung, status post radiation, history of SVC syndrome with
multiple stents in the right arm. Evaluate for obstruction.

PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] present and supervising. 15 cc of contrast was
injected through the sheath in the right arm and a venogram was
obtained. The venogram demonstrates filling and patency of stent
with a tiny residue of clot left.

The patient no longer requires TPA and hence the sheath was
pulled. The patient will be transfused 500 units of heparin per

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an 82 year old
nonsmoker, active female who had undergone a right upper lobe
resection for T1 N0 adenocarcinoma in [**2139-12-20**], who
presented with right upper lobe mass found on routine
computerized tomography scan for follow up.  It was discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] and his plan was to do a resection at this
time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant
for high cholesterol, osteoarthritis, and thrombocytosis.
She is status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Avapro, Lipitor,
Hydrochlorothiazide, Vioxx, Nexium, Os Cal, aspirin,
multivitamins, _______  eyedrops and Hydroxyurea.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nondrinker, nonsmoker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung cancer in her brother,
pancreatic cancer in another brother, colon cancer in a
sister.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination shows her
afebrile with stable vital signs.  Her lungs were clear.
Heart was regular.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Bowel sounds were present.  Extremities were
warm and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies were all within normal
limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2140-4-5**], for a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge
resection of the right upper lobe mass, please see the
operative report for further details.  The patient was
transferred to the floor postoperatively.  She had an
epidural for pain.  Her chest tubes were put in in the
Operating Room and these were kept to suction.  The patient
continued to do well postoperatively.  On postoperative day
#1, it was noted that her sodium had dropped from a normal
preoperative level in [**Month (only) 404**], to 123.  Therefore, she was
followed for serial sodiums to monitor for changes.  Her
sodium dropped to as low as 117.  At this point in time, she
had mental status changes and it is decided the patient would
be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was started
on a 3 percent sodium chloride drip for slow correction of
her sodium.  She slowly improved from this and her sodium
improved.  By postoperative day #2, the sodium had climbed up
to 123.  Renal was consulted for evaluation for syndrome of
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.  They felt that the
management was correct and when her sodium was corrected up
to a level of mid 20s that she could be started on a fluid
restriction and salt tablets.  Her sodium slowly corrected
over the next couple of days and she was put on fluid
restriction as well as a high sodium diet.  Her sodium was
followed closely and on the day of discharge it had climbed
back up to 127.  It was felt that this drop in sodium was
linked either to the long surgery itself or to the
possibility of the mass causing trouble and it was also felt
that this could be treated with sodium tablets and fluid
restriction.  Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation
of her ambulation and her strength and it is found that she
was doing quite well and could be discharged home when
medically stable.  She did well over the next couple of days
and her chest tubes were removed.

On postoperative day #3, she was doing well, tolerating a
regular diet and her sodium returned to a level of 127 prior
to discharge.  Therefore it was decided that the patient
could be discharged home.  The patient was discharged home in
stable condition.  She was instructed to follow up with her
primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck of her sodium as well as
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in two to three weeks for
evaluation of her wounds.  She was discharged on all of her
home medications as well as ________for pain, Colace, stool
softener and sodium chloride tablets, 2 gm p.o. t.i.d.  The
patient is discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Right upper lobe mass, status post video-assisted
   thoracoscopic wedge resection of the right upper lobe.
2. Severe acute hyponatremia, status post correction with 3
   percent normal saline drip as well as sodium chloride
   tablet.
3. Right upper lobe adenocarcinoma, status post right upper
   lobe wedge resection.
4. High cholesterol.
5. Osteoarthritis.
6. Thrombocytosis.
7. Status post appendectomy.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

Service:  FENARD INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49-year-old
male with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2200-3-3**] on chemotherapy and XRT as recently as one week
prior to admission who was in usual state of health until a
few days prior to admission when he had decreased po intake,
confusion and nausea and vomiting.  For these symptoms, he
had been self medicated with prescribed morphine sulfate and
one day prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 **]
Hospital, he had contact[**Name (NI) **] his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28049**], who
recommended immediate ..........  The ambulance was sent to
pick him up with plans to take him to [**Hospital6 **] but
because he was short of breath and evaluated to be in need of
immediate treatment, EMS brought him to [**Hospital3 **] for
care.  There, the patient was noted to be hypovolemic and was
initially given intravenous fluids.  His potassium was
measured at 6.1.  This was treated.

He was noted to be short of breath at 4 liters per minute.
Oxygen was begun and the patient was admitted to the floor.
He subsequently desaturated to 90% to 91% and remained at
this level despite increasing his oxygen supplementation with
a nonrebreather mask.  An arterial blood gas done at that
time revealed a pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 26, PO2 of 63.  His heart
rate was measured to be in the 130 to 170 range and atrial
fibrillation.  (She has a history of atrial fibrillation, but
now demonstrated for rapid ventricular response).  For the
shortness of breath, he received Lasix and his chest x-ray
was done which showed infiltrates bilaterally, left worse
than right.  He subsequently had a perfusion scan (apparently
ventilation scan was not possible) which was interpreted as
high probability for pulmonary embolus.

Although they were unable to perform the ventilation part,
they did see complete perfusion defect in the right upper
lobe area that was not observed to have infiltrates on the
chest x-ray.  Based on this result, medical team at [**Hospital3 11531**] started him on fractionated heparin and in
addressing his atrial fibrillation they gave him intravenous
metoprolol, intravenous digoxin and intravenous diltiazem
followed by diltiazem drip.  He subsequently had a decrease
in his systolic blood pressure to 80 which improved with
intravenous fluids for his cancer.  He had an MRI of his
brain which was read as free of metastases.

He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Fenard Intensive Care Unit for further management in
light of possible pulmonary embolus.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Depression
2.  Peptic ulcer disease requiring partial gastrectomy.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2200-5-3**] at [**Hospital6 **] showed esophageal [**Female First Name (un) **].
3.  Atrial fibrillation on digoxin and diltiazem
4.  Small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2200-3-3**] with a
central lung mass treated with carboplatin BP 16, XRT
initially.  No brain or bone metastases on initial staging
work up.  Extensive disease in the right lung with right
middle and right upper lobe compression.  Chemo help in [**2200-5-3**] apparently for poor performance status.
5.  Microcytic anemia

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Proton pump inhibitor on fractionated heparin
2.  Paxil
3.  Colace
4.  Diflucan
5.  Carafate

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for an aunt with a deep venous
thrombosis treated with urokinase at [**Hospital6 15291**] in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Long time smoking history.  Lives with aunt.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF TRANSFER:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.8??????, heart rate 120s, blood
pressure 109/52, CO2 70% on 100% nonrebreather, respiratory
rate 30, weight 50 kg
GENERAL:  Moderate respiratory distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Mucous membranes moist.
Pupils equally round and reactive.  Extraocular movements
intact.
NECK:  8 cm jugular venous distention at 45??????, supple, full
range of motion
CHEST:  Clear right upper lobe, but otherwise rhonchi and
crackles bilaterally with prominent decreased breath sounds
in the lower third, left greater than right.
HEART:  Tachycardia, irregularly irregular with normal S1 and
S2, few bowel sounds, distended.
RECTAL:  Guaiac negative.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, cyanotic digits.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3, no obvious motor or
sensory abnormality.

LABS AND STUDIES:  White blood cell count 15, hematocrit 44,
platelets 233.  PT 14, PTT 50.7. s od 138, potassium 4, BUN
55, creatinine 1.3.  Electrocardiogram - atrial fibrillation
at 122 in S1 and at Q3, question of less than equal to [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevation in V2 and V3, loss of R waves in V1 and V2.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Fenard Intensive Care Unit and had a hospital course notable
as follows.

1.  PULMONARY:  Intubated emergently on arrival for hypoxic
respiratory distress.  Required high levels of ventilatory
support and continued poor oxygenation requiring sedation and
eventually neuromuscular paralysis.  He was initially placed
on fractionated heparin over concerns of a possible pulmonary
embolus based on outside hospital perfusion scan results.
However, there was some concern about whether the findings
could be fully compatible with pulmonary embolus given the
clinical history, so the patient underwent CT angiogram of
the chest which revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolus,
but did show significant parenchymal abnormalities with
ground glass opacities and septal thickening, left greater
than right, relative sparing of the right upper lobe.
Differential diagnoses for this was broad and included
possible lymphangitic spread of tumor versus pneumonia or
other interstitial lung process.  Bronchoscopy was done with
lavage which yielded no organisms on gram stain that could
definitively diagnose the pneumonia.  There were discussions
with the family about whether a video assisted thoracoscopic
biopsy of the lung would be helpful in the diagnosis of his
condition.  He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics, but
failed to improve significantly and after discussions with
the family and thoracic surgery service, his family decided
not to pursue video assisted thoroscopic biopsy of the lungs.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had mild electrocardiogram
changes which were concerning for possible mild cardiac
ischemia.  This could have been rate related, but given his
electrocardiogram changes serial cardiac enzymes were sent
which showed evidence of myocardial damage consistent with
non ST elevations.  The patient had initially been on
fractionated heparin although this had been stopped after a
negative CT angiogram looking for pulmonary embolus.  It was
restarted in the setting of positive cardiac enzymes.

ADDENDUM:

On gastrointestinal examination the patient had a distended
belly with poor bowel sounds and upon rectal examination
evidence of fecal impaction.  He had a KUB that showed a
massive amount of stool and he had manual disimpaction for
this, and a CT of the abdomen which again showed mildly
dilated bowel, evidence of stool impaction.  He was seen by
the gastroenterology service who recommended nasogastric tube
decompression with monitoring, with consideration given to
surgical consultation given his overall poor status.  This
was deferred.  His constipation was treated unsuccessfully
with enemas.

After extensive discussion with family members about Mr.
[**Known lastname 16214**] poor overall state of health and poor prognosis
from his respiratory failure due to parenchymal process
involving the lung of unclear etiology, the family decided
that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would not like continued prolonged
artificial ventilatory support.  After discussion about the
patient's previously expressed wishes regarding this matter,
it was decided to extubate Mr. [**Known lastname **] and withdraw all
artificial life-sustaining measures and focus solely on
comfort care.  This was done on [**6-15**] and the patient's
subsequently passed away in the evening at 6:37 PM.  The
family was at the bedside and notified.  A postmortem
examination was requested.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure with bilateral left greater
than right parenchymal disease of unclear etiology, possible
pneumonia versus lymphangitic spread of tumor versus
interstitial lung process of unclear etiology.
2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3. Constipation with fecal impaction.
4. History of small cell lung carcinoma.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

CXR:
FINDINGS:  There is no definite focal consolidation.  No
superimposed edema is evident.  There is prominence in the
aorticopulmonary window, which may relate to the patient's known
lung cancer diagnosis.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits accounting for the depth of inspiration and AP portable
technique.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
which may be due to a small effusion.  There is no definite
right effusion.  No pneumothorax is
seen.  A Port-A-Cath is evident with the tip projected over the
superior vena cava.
.
IMPRESSION:  No clear consolidation or superimposed edema.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Head CT:
FINDINGS:  The extracalvarial soft tissues are unremarkable.
The calvarium and skull base are intact.  The paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear.  The globes are intact with
lenses in place.  Intracranially, the ventricles are midline and
normal in size and configuration.  The cortical sulci and
subarachnoid cisterns are likewise unremarkable.  [**Doctor Last Name **]
matter-white matter interface is well defined.  There is no mass
effect or CT evidence suggestive of underlying vasogenic edema.
Additionally, no intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute
cortical stroke is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable head CT examination.  No secondary
evidence to suggest underlying metastatic disease.
.
Renal U/S [**2129-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male with PMH newly diagnosed metastatic small cell cancer
presents with severe neutropenia and ARF with electrolyte
abnormalities.
.
1. ARF: Most likely of multifactorial etiology including
pre-renal, and intrinsic renal dysfunction (FeNa 8.5%).
Intrinsic renal may be [**1-7**] cisplatin toxicity, tumor lysis
syndrome, on top of CKD from HTN (baseline unknown). Post-renal
etiology seems less likely, as pt is urinating and renal U/S
with no evidence of hydronephrosis. The urinary output increased
steadily and is 150 cc/hour today ([**2129-3-28**]). Creatinine slowly
trending down, down to 8 today , as well as phosphate, down to 6
from >8. A renal consult was obtained early on which advised 3%
saline for 20 cc/hour for 1 Liter, with which Na corrected to
127. The renal team did not feel that the patient had tumor
lysis syndrome. The patient has been on a 1.5 L per day free
water restriction. The patient does not wish to have
hemodialysis, and the renal consult did not feel this was
appropriate. He was given phos-binder, his medicines were
renally dosed, and diovan and celebrex were held. In discussion
with his oncologist his chemotherapy regimen is modified to no
longer have platinums.
.
2. Hypocalcemia: DDx includes precipitation into CaPo4 in
setting of hyperphos, tumor lysis syndrome. Calcium was repleted
in a conservative manner in view of his hyperphosphatemia. His
cardiac status was closely monitored and he did not develop any
cardiac symptoms.
.
3. Hyponatremia: Likely [**1-7**] hypovolemia. Not sodium avid by
lytes, but may be [**1-7**] concomitant intrinsic renal dz.
.
4. Fever and Neutropenia: The patient was placed on neutropenic
precautions. He had new infiltrates on CXR. He received vanc and
cefepime, renally dosed. Vanc level was very high so he has not
been given new dose yet. Sputum grew pan sensitive E Coli, and
MSSA.  He was switched to levaquin only.  Respiratory symptoms
improved.  He was started on neupogen with good response and his
neutropenia resolved. However his neupogen was stopped late, and
he has a high level of leukocytosis.
.
6.Thrombocytopenia: Most likely [**1-7**] chemo. Unlikely DIC (nl INR,
fibrinogen 734). HIT negative.  REsolved over first few days of
admission.
.
7. Lung cancer with bone metastasis:
Resulting in diffuse bony pain. A pain consult was obtained. He
is on oxycontin, dilaudid for breakthrough pain, and neurontin
low dose qhs. This worked well and at rest he had no pain.  But
with walking he c/o left hip pain. He will resume chemotherapy
with his primary oncologist.
.
8. COPD: continued inhaler per home regimen; alb/atrov nebs
standing every six hours. Discontinued propanolol, which the
patient was probably taking for his social phobia, and started
low dose metoprolol tid to avoid rebound tachycardia.  Due to
persistent wheezing, he was started on systemic steroids. now to
taper
.
9. Depression: Effexor was renally dosed and duloxetine was
d/c'ed. QTc was monitored on EKGs. Social work worked with the
patient.
.
10. HTN: Diovan was held. BP remained stable.
.
11. Hypothyroid: continue levothyroxine.
.
.
DNR DNI: The patient decided on a meeting with medical team and
his brother on 4/ 20 to be made DNR DNI. His brother is his
health care proxy.

orthostatic hypotension with a decrease between 10 to 30
units systolic blood pressure.

On postoperative day nine, the patient continued to have
orthostatic hypotension and was given 150 cc piggyback of
albumin which resulted in no change in his orthostatic
numbers.  The highest physical therapy level the patient
achieved during his hospital stay was a stage IV, and at
discharge was roughly a stage III.  The patient was
reassessed, and the decision was made to transfer the patient
to rehabilitation to continue with physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 98.4

[**12-18**] CXR There is an increasing hydropneumothorax in the left
hemithorax since [**2168-12-14**]. The right lung is clear. The right IJ
line has been removed.

[**12-13**]  Chest CT 1) Interval placement of left-sided chest tube
with decrease in large left- sided pleural effusion with shift
of the mediastinum back to the left. Small pneumothorax with
loculated hydropneumothorax.
2) Partial re-expansion of the left lung with patchy opacities.
These likely represent areas of atelectasis.
3) Scattered nodules within the right lobe and spiculated mass
within the left upper lobe appears stable in short interval.
4) Right renal mass, left adrenal mass and osseous lesions again
identified

Brief Hospital Course:
Pleural Effusion-Pt with known longstanding left sided malignant
effusion. CT placed in the ED as per HPI and pt intubated due to
inability to lay flat for CT to evaluate effusion but was
quickly weaned. Pt had doxycyline Pleurodesis on [**12-9**] and 14
and CTube removed [**12-13**] due to pt discomfort and continued low
grade fevers. She continued to have dullness at her left base
with complete whiteout of L hemithorax except for area of
pneumothorax on follow-up CXR, so IP saw pt and placed pleuridex
[**12-18**] and drained 500cc serous fluid with plan for weekly
pleurocentesis in pulmonary clinic. She was breathing
comfortably and had O2Sats of 94% on room air upon discharge.

Pancytopenia-Due to recent chemotherapy with
paclitaxol/carboplatin although counts responded briskly to GCSF
except for platelets.  She was initially treated as neutropenia
and sepsis due to hypotension and fever with Vancomycin,
gentamycin, cefepime which were discontinued on transfer to the
floor since no culture data was positive. Pt has history of
thrombocytopenia, and platelet count was slowly declining. We
started procrit and followed CBC daily. HitAb neg but held on
heparin for HIT I. DIC panel negative. There were no known
offending meds but did change ranitidine for protonix since it
was only suspected med.

Hypotension-Pt had acute episode of hypotension with intial
intubation which responded well to aggressive fluid boluses. Pt
had corasyn stim test to rule out adrenal insuffuciency which
was equivocal at 18, so she was started on stress dose steroids.
She was also placed on fludricorisone due to an elevated
potassium and low sodium. Pt remained normotensive upon transfer
to the floor on [**12-10**] and weaned off of steroids since there was
no suspected reason for acute adrenal insufficiency.  BP and
lytes remained stable for the remaineder of her hospitalization
except for mild hypernatremia that responded well to
encouragement of free water intake.

SVT-Pt with new afib per attg. Pt with LAA in previous ECG most
likely due to longstanding HTN. Acute hypotension and stressed
state may have contributed. No anticoagulation since it was
thought to be transient.

PE-Pt with known subsegmental PE on admission CT. Pt with
appropriate sats on room air. SC heparin stopped for HIT
possiblity and didn't anticoagulate initially due to brain mets
although attending considering anticoagulation. No role for
repeat CTPA since she has known PE.

Oral thrush-Due to steroid use. Improving on clotrimazole
lozenges now that steriods stopped.

NSCLC-Pt receiving chemo prior to admission and effusion is not
reason to stop treatment. Will restart chemo if Plat ct >100 per
attg likely Iressa. Chest CT shows no interval change in size of
pulmonary nodules post chemo.

DM-Pt had poorly controlled blood sugars while on steroids, but
were controlled to <150 when steroids weaned. She was initially
on RISS but this was discontinued with steroid taper.

Pain-Patient had pain at CTube site initially which was well
controlled with oxycontin 10mg q12hours. Percocet prn was added
with increasing pain after placement of tunneled pleuridex but
plan is to wean as tolerated.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old man
with history of non small cell lung cancer stage 3A, status
post neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and x-ray therapy
who presents for left pneumonectomy.  The patient underwent
left pneumonectomy on [**2131-1-19**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer, spinal stenosis, AAA,
nephrolithiasis, bladder cancer.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, Theophylline,
Celexa, Proscar.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 97.8,
pulse 75, blood pressure 115/64, respiratory rate 20 and 100%
oxygen saturation.  Generally the patient was ill appearing,
elderly man in no apparent distress.  Cardiac exam revealed
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Abdominal exam revealed the belly was soft,
nontender, non distended with normal bowel sounds.  Lung
examination revealed lungs that were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent left pneumonectomy
for stage 3A non small cell lung cancer on [**2131-1-19**].  His
course was complicated by postoperative atrial fibrillation,
Serratia bacteremia and bronchopleural fistula requiring a
chest tube placement as well as COPD exacerbation requiring
steroids.  The patient was scheduled to undergo bronchoscopy
for evaluation and possible drainage of infected material
thought to be seated from his Serratia bacteremia.  At the
time of bronchoscopy the patient's respiratory status
decompensated and a bronchoscopy was not performed.  At that
point the patient elected to be DNR/DNI with possibility of
cardioversion for rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient
progressed in his respiratory decompensation and the patient
eventually expired on [**2131-2-16**] at 1:15 a.m.  His wife was
notified of the patient's expiration and the attending was
also notified.

Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]/MED  Please note that the patient was admitted
on the Orthopedic Service and discharged on the Medicine
Service.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] is a 79 year old
male with a past medical history significant for a non-small
cell lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain status post
two cycles of chemotherapy with Carboplatin/Taxol, who
experienced a fall on [**9-15**] upon exiting his car and
walking five to six steps.  He notes no preceding events
prior to the fall, and notes that it was not mechanical in
etiology.  The patient was taken to an outside hospital and
was found to have a left hip subtrochanteric fracture without
neurovascular impairment.  At the time, he was found to have
a decreased hematocrit and was transfused.  He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for an open reduction and internal fixation.

In the Operating Room during this procedure, the patient had
two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia associated with
a decrease in blood pressure ameliorated by cardioversion on
each occasion.  The patient was started on an Amiodarone
drip, remained normotensive throughout the rest of the case,
and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

The patient had a third episode of supraventricular
tachycardia while in the Intensive Care Unit which was
treated successfully with adenosine.  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] experienced
a fourth episode of supraventricular tachycardia while in the
Intensive Care Unit which converted into normal sinus rhythm
with Lopressor.  On subsequent episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia with hypotension, the patient was bolused with
normal saline.

The Cardiology Service was consulted and evaluated the
patient in the Intensive Care Unit.  The recommendations per
Cardiology were to continue the Amiodarone intravenously and
continue to use Adenosine as needed for symptomatic
supraventricular tachycardia.

The patient was transferred to the Floor and continued on
intravenous Amiodarone and was started on an oral Amiodarone
load.  On [**9-19**], the patient was transferred to the
Medical Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma diagnosed in
[**2186-8-6**], metastatic to the brain.  The patient was
noted to have three left frontal lobe metastases, who of
which have regressed after systemic chemotherapy.  The
patient is status post two cycles of chemotherapy,
Carboplatin/Taxol.  During the last admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**]
was evaluated by the Radiation Oncology Service and was to
have a stereotactic radio surgery for removal of the brain
metastases.
2.  Malignant pleural effusions status post pleurodesis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  History of supraventricular tachycardia during his last
hospitalization.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6.  Status post meningioma resection in [**2177**].
7.  Status post left inguinal hernia repair in [**2182**].

ALLERGIES:   Dilantin (liver toxicity, rash).

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. three times a day.
2.  Amiodarone intravenous drip.

the last 54 years.  No children.  He is a retired Lieutenant
Colonel in the Air Force and has worked as a defense
contractor.  He has no known occupational exposures.  He
notes a half pack per day usage of tobacco for 30 years.  He
also notes one cocktail imbibed each evening.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother expired at age 75; she had a
history of hypertension.  Father deceased at age 87 secondary
to pneumonia.  His brother is 74 years old and in good
health.  His sister had passed away from breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.0 F.; blood pressure
150/80; heart rate 62; respiratory rate 18; oxygen saturation
95 to 96% on room air.  In general, the patient appears in no
acute distress sitting up in a chair.  HEENT:  Sclerae
anicteric.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Oropharynx is clear.  Pupils equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy and no
carotid bruits.  Chest is symmetric excursion, moderate air
movement, no dullness to percussion.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2; II/VI systolic ejection
murmur with no gallops, no rubs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Left
leg was bandaged in an ACE.  Right leg had one plus edema.
Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Alert and
oriented times three, appropriate responses with mood and

STUDIES:  ECG on [**2186-9-18**], demonstrated sinus rhythm,
right bundle branch block, QRS morphology, potential left
atrial abnormality, no significant changes from previous
tracing on [**9-17**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] has a history of
supraventricular tachycardia present during his last
hospitalization treated with beta blockade.  He had
experienced a fall without a clear precipitating factor or
mechanical reason which led to this admission.  During his
prior admission, the patient was asymptomatic during his
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia on Telemetry.  It is
possible that the patient's supraventricular tachycardia led
to his fall prior to admission.  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] had experienced
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia during the procedure
and peri-procedure and he was initiated on an Amiodarone drip
after two cardioversions.

The Cardiology Service was following and recommended to
continue an Amiodarone load.  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] will be continued
on Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a day until [**9-30**].  He
will begin a maintenance dose of 200 mg p.o. q. day starting
on [**10-1**].

Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] has a history of hypertension and has been on
Lopressor and Terazosin as an outpatient.  During this
admission, an ACE inhibitor was initiated and he will be
titrated up on this medication as tolerated.

Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for his
supraventricular tachycardia on [**10-18**] at 01:00 p.m. in
the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.

2.  ORTHOPEDICS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was diagnosed with a left
subtrochanteric hip fracture status post fall and transferred
from the outside hospital for open reduction and internal
fixation.  This procedure was performed on [**2186-9-17**],
with the complication of supraventricular tachycardia as
described above.  The patient remained on the Orthopedic
Service until transfer on [**2186-9-19**].  Physical Therapy
had evaluated the patient and continued to follow while
admitted.

Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was changed to a touch-down weight bearing status
to the left lower extremity on postoperative day three.
Recommendations were made to continue daily dressing changes
to the wound sites and the patient was to continue with
thigh-high TEDS stockings to the lower extremities.

3.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was recently diagnosed
in [**2186-8-6**] with non-small cell lung cancer and has
received two cycles of Carboplatin/Taxol.  He is being
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his oncologic care.  During his
last admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he was
evaluated by Radiation Oncology for the brain metastases and
stereotactic radio surgery was recommended.  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was
scheduled to have this SRS on [**9-19**], however, this
therapy was deferred while he is dealing with the acute issue
of his hip fracture.  Further decisions regarding his
oncologic care - SRS and chemotherapy - will be determined by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was noted to have a significant hematocrit drop
while admitted.  Postoperatively the patient received two
units of packed red blood cells.  On the day prior to
discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] received another two units of packed
red blood cells.  Hematocrit is pending at the time of this
discharge.

Secondary to the patient's chemotherapy, last cycle completed
[**9-14**], his cell counts are expected to nadir on [**9-21**].

Secondary to Mr. [**Known lastname 95027**] brain metastases and issue of
anti-coagulation that was raised at his left hip open
reduction and internal fixation, the decision was to
anti-coagulate Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] with maintenance doses of Lovenox,
30 mg subcutaneously q. 12 hours, for a total of six weeks.

markings in a ""crazy paving"" pattern in the upper zones (2:21)
may reflect an inflammatory or infectious process, or
lymphangenic spread of tumor. 3.
Rounded atalectasis at the right lung base (2:33) with

tiny calcifications within the spinal canal (2:23). 6. s/p CABG.



Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF MICU COURSE (MICU GREEN):
On [**2167-6-11**] he underwent flexible brochoscopy.  The bronch showed
98% occlusion of the LUL and LLL which was not amenable to
stenting.  A BAL was sent.  During the procedure he became
hypertensive to the 180s and subsequently desaturated to 78% and
was noted to be wheezing.  The procedure was stopped and he was
given nebs, lasix 40IV and nitropaste.  He had an ABG which was
7.31/78/83 and was thereafter placed on BiPAP and transferred to
the MICU.
.
In the MICU, he was placed on bipap and given an additional 80mg
IV Lasix.  He improved, was diuresed -2.5L and was weaned to
nasal canula.  His code status was confirmed to be DNR but okay
to intubate for short-term, reversible causes.  His home lasix
was changed to lasix 80mg IV BID.  His blood pressure
medications were uptitrated to obtain better blood pressure
control.  His Lisinopril was increased to 20mg daily and he was
given 1 dose of Captopril 6.25mg PO.  His outpatint oncologist
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the inpatient heme-onc team was consulted for
plans for chemotherapy.  He has a history of hemoptysis after
bronchoscopy in the past but did not have a problem with this
while in the ICU.  He was hypoglycemic to the 40s overnight on
[**2167-6-11**] and his lantus was decreased to 10 units per day.  This
was likely from not eating during the day.
.
Given his tenuous respiratory status, he was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to receive chemotherapy in the ICU.  According to
interventional pulmonology, there are no further options for
stenting or tumor debridement that they can offer.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was electively intubated for hypoxia and concerns
that he would not tolerate the fluid loads of chemotherapy
without positive pressure ventilation. He was emphatically DNR
and was willing to accept intubation only as a temporary
measure. He was continued on treatment for post obstructive PNA
with vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole. He tolerated his
chemotherapy (C1D1 cisplatin + etoposide [**2167-6-13**]). Howevever,
on day 6 of his chemo he developed persistent nausea and
vomiting, so extubation was deferred. He was hypotensive at
times, and on and off pressors. He was started on TPN for
nutrition due to his persistent nausea and vomiting. He was
ultimately weaned off the ventilator and extubated on [**2167-6-22**].
On [**2167-6-23**] he was doing very well, and was tolerating POs and
comfortable on NC O2. His only complaint was cough. He was
called out to OMED.
.
OMED Course:
On arrival on the floor he was conversant and comfortable. He
became suddenly unresponsive and cyanotic. A Code Blue was
called. Initially there was concern for seizure, and he was
emergently given lorazepam IV. Once he was placed on a cardiac
monitor he was found to be in coarse Vfib. Given concern for
torsade de pointes magnesium was given as an IV push as
amiodarone was drawn up. However, his mother and HCP, who was in
the room for the event, asked that resusitation be halted. The
patient had been clearly DNR, and she felt that further measures
were not consistent with his goals of care. He died with his
mother at the bedside. Pastoral care and SW were called to
assist the family with the mourning process. His ICU team was
present for the code and provided support for the family as
well.

with wheezing, so chest CT was obtained showing right hilar 3 cm
mass encasing bronchus. 1 month ago he c/o complaining of left
lower extremity weakness. A head MR showed multiple
ring-enhancing lesions and he was eventually diagnosed with
metastatic lung Ca. CXR and chest CT showed right upper lobe
mass. Bronch performed [**2103-2-13**] at [**Hospital 17065**] Hospital showed
3cm lesion encasing right hilar bronchus. He was transferred to

Pertinent Results:
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2103-3-9**]: A total of 6 ring enhancing lesions seen
throughout the cerebral hemipheres and a 7th ring enhancing
lesion either centered within the meninges overlying the right
parietal lobe or within the adjacent bone.

MR C/T/L Spine [**2103-3-9**]:
1) Cervicothoracic imaging reveals no evidence of bony
metastases or cord impingement. No abnormal intraspinal
enhancement is seen.
2) Lumbosacral spine imaging demonstrates normal vertebrae and
no abnormal enhancement to indicate metastatic infiltration.

CXR [**2103-4-4**]
1) Lung nodules are unchanged.
2) Questionable increased right perihilar opacities on the right
side could represent early pneumonia or aspiration.

CT head [**2103-4-4**]
1) Multiple cerebral metastases as seen in the prior MRI from
[**2103-3-8**].
2) There is a hyperdense area in the right parietal region that
suggest a small acute hemorrhage. This appears to be new when
compared to the MRI from [**2103-3-8**].
3) Questionable hyperdense area around the left parietal mass
could represent hemorrhage. However, the patient had a small
amount of hemorrhage around this area on [**2103-3-8**].
4) Increased extra-axial space in the left frontal lobe. This is
unchanged when compared to the prior MRI.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Shock: Cardiogenic +/- sepsis. Pt was put on pressors for
blood pressure control.  These were then stopped, after
discussion with family, as pt has end stage metastatic lung
cancer.  After pressors were stopped, pt's blood pressure
remained fairly stable and his mentation improved somewhat, as
he was responsive.  Aspirin and heparin were avoided due to
intracranial bleed.  Pt was loaded on amiodarone, as well, which
was eventually discontinued in efforts to make him comfort
measures only.  Pt was also extubated the day prior to discharge
and continued to have good O2 sats.

2) Lung Ca: No treatment for primary nodule. Brain mets s/p XRT.
Pt was initially continued on decadron and dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis; however, these were discontinued as pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].

3) ID: Pt was initially placed on Levoflox/Vanc for possible
PNA, but these were discontinued as pt made [**Name (NI) 3225**].

4) sedation/pain control: pt was placed on a fentanyl drip
during most of the hospitalization.  At the time of discharge to
hospice, he was on fentanyl, and was given a prescription for
Roxinol.

5) Proph: Pt initially placed on PPI, pneumoboots. No sc hep.
Discontinued as [**Name (NI) 3225**].

6) Code status: Pt was made [**Name (NI) 3225**] per discussion with family.  Pt
thereafter extubated, pressors/antibiotics/other unnecessary
meds were stopped.  Labs were not drawn.

7) Dispo: Pt had bed at Hospice House and was discharged there.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
female who was admitted on [**7-22**] for resection of a left lower
lobe adenocarcinoma.  She was transferred from the MICU
service after a prolonged hospital course, notable for
multiple PNA's and atrial fibrillation.  She was transferred
to the MICU for failure to wean.  This patient was first seen
by pulmonary in [**5-7**] when she began complaining of new onset
shortness of breath plus notable for chronic cough.  She had
some weight loss and decreased appetite.  She was admitted
for surgery on [**7-22**].  There was a left lower lobe resection
done with pathology that showed adenocarcinoma.  She was
extubated after surgery and then on [**7-25**] she went into atrial
fibrillation and her blood pressure dropped to the 90's and
she had shortness of breath.  She was given Pronestyl,
Lopressor, Lasix and she was diuresed with 500 cc, eventually
converted back to sinus rhythm.  Her troponin at that time
was 3.4 and her CK MB was negative.  She again became short
of breath on [**7-26**], diagnosed with left lower lobe collapse on
chest x-ray.  She was intubated and had left lower lobe thick
secretions and collapse was thought to be secondary to mucus
plugging.  ABG at that time on vent was 7.46 PH, CO2 46, O2
107.  She was rebronch'd the next day on the left airway that
showed plugging.  She was briefly on Diamox and weaned to a
pressure support of [**5-11**], resting in an IMV overnight.
Respiratory rate was in the 20's and total volume 200-400 at
that time, then extubated.  She was reintubated secondary to
a decreased saturation and an increased CO2 and rebronch'd on
[**7-29**] with thick secretions and a plug on [**7-29**].  She was
started on Augmentin prophylaxis on [**7-29**] for continued
secretions.  A tracheostomy was placed on [**7-31**].  On [**8-5**] her
Augmentin was discontinued.  Then she was slowly weaned off
her ventilation.  She tolerated her trach mask.  She had a
period of atrial fibrillation on [**8-7**] with rates in the 70's
and a systolic blood pressure in the 70's.  She was put on
her trach mask for 24 hours and did well but did not tolerate
PMV.  The patient had complained of difficulty breathing,
also had secretions and was unable to tolerate oral food.  A
PEG was placed on [**8-10**].  She was then transferred back to the
floor on [**8-11**].  Cardiology fellow called emergently for
systolic blood pressure in the 60's and heart rates in the
30's.  The patient had been subtherapeutic on Pronestyl.  She
was administered 200 joules with a brief normal sinus rhythm,
transient increase in systolic blood pressure but then
reverted back to atrial fibrillation.  She received Esmolol
and Amiodarone, eventually converting to sinus rhythm.
Anticoagulation was then recommended.  Amiodarone was
continued at 400 mg tid times one week and later changed to
400 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On [**8-15**] at 5 a.m. the patient was found cyanotic
with her tracheostomy mask off and saturations from 80-85%.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU with an O2
saturation in the 90's and heart rate in the 150's with a
respiratory rate of 28.  She was given Lasix 20 mg IV, became
unable to maintain her saturations on her trach mask.  ABG at
that time was 7.39, 62 and 75.  Patient then came back into
sinus rhythm at 83 beats per minute.  The patient had
moderate thick, yellow secretions.  She was bagged, tried to
replace the trach mass but saturations continued from 88-90%.
She was placed back on the ventilator.  She was brought back
to the ICU and found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
via chest x-ray.  She was then bronch'd on [**8-15**] in the morning
and found to have minimal secretions.  Her hospital course
was notable also for intermittent confusion but baseline
orientation.  She was also hypotensive to pain medications.
She currently has some difficulty breathing on the
ventilator, was otherwise comfortable and denies pain or any
other complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease.  She had
an AAA repair in [**2100**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**], notable for
hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, right hip
replacement, 100 pack year history of smoking, seasonal
allergies and emphysema by pathology.

ALLERGIES:  Possibly Ciprofloxacin causing confusion, dated
[**11/2118**], otherwise no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer to the MICU, Premarin .625 mg po q
d, Amiodarone 400 mg po bid, Levaquin 500 mg po q d, subcu
Heparin [**Hospital1 **], Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Aspirin 81 mg po q d,
Multivitamin, Albuterol nebulizer and Albuterol inhaler q 4
hours, Impact with fiber 50 cc per hour, Dulcolax, Combivent.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at 93, mother died at 72 and
father died at 84, all in reasonably good health until later
years.  No family history.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 10059**], employed as
a social worker, no asbestos exposure, now retired, smoked
two packs per day for about 6 years, then quit, drinks
occasionally.  Her proxy is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 36924**], [**Telephone/Fax (3) 92812**]?
(last digit missing).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on transfer to
the MICU, temperature 98.6, pulse 67-99, blood pressure 88/40
to 100/44, ins and outs, positive 250 cc, ventilator SIMV 450
times 8, 7.5 and 50% O2, pressure support 15, total volume
290, saturation 98%.  In general, cachectic, elderly white
female lying in bed, tracheostomy on ventilator, in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Shows PERRLA, EOMI, grossly intact, NCAT.
Neck supple, EJ engorged, unable to assess JVP.  Heart,
regular rate and rhythm with 3/6 systolic murmur left lower
sternal border, stable with respirations and no S3 or S4.
Pulmonary, diminished sounds at bases, anterior bronchial
breath sounds on left.  Abdomen distended, PEG in place,
positive bowel sounds, nontender and soft.  Extremities,
distal pulses full, trace edema, symmetric.  Neuro, patient
is very hard of hearing, difficult to arouse, but once
aroused she is alert and appropriate and able to mouth words
appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU, white blood cells
17,000, hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 32.5, platelet count
282,000.  Dipstick urinalysis showed moderate blood, positive
nitrites, 100 protein, glucose negative, ketones trace,
bilirubin negative.  Glucose 125, BUN 26, creatinine 0.4,
sodium 131, potassium 4.0, chloride 90, CO2 30, calcium 9.2,
phosphorus 2.4, magnesium 1.4.  Arterial blood gas with PH
7.46, CO2 47 and PO2 122.  Chest x-ray from [**8-15**] showed some
interval clearing of the left base with progressive
infiltrate and left upper lobe and right upper lobe
consistent with infection vs edema.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  This is an 85-year-old status post left
lower lobe lobectomy for adenocarcinoma.  Hospital course was
complicated by respiratory distress from mucus plugging,
rapid atrial fibrillation and failure to wean.  The patient
now has a tracheostomy and a PEG tube status post an episode
of respiratory distress on the floor, likely secondary to
decreased FIO2, rapid atrial fibrillation with elevated white
blood cells and infiltrate on chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  Pneumonia, given multiple infiltrates on the
chest x-ray and elevated white blood cell count, treating
aggressively for gram negative and will double cover with
Levaquin and Ceftaz.  One dose of Levaquin already given in
the a.m.  Patient's effusions are bilateral.  Would tap if
clinical course does not improve.
2.  Congestive heart failure:  Patient likely has diastolic
dysfunction when in rapid atrial fibrillation.  She was then
bolused with fluid for hypotension.  Would likely keep the
patient slightly dry as tolerated by blood pressure,
ventilation, continue to wean as tolerated and change
pressure support as tolerated.
3.  Cardiology:  Rhythm, atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone.
We sent LFTs and TSH and we will taper per cardiology.  She
is on Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.  If
continues on Amiodarone would consider reconsulting and more
invasive measures.
4.  Hemodynamics:  The patient is slightly dry, most recent
echocardiogram shows no systolic dysfunction though since
then she has had a slow troponin leak likely from failure.
5.  Infectious Disease:  Pneumonia as above.
6.  Renal/ Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient's
electrolytes need repletion, especially given her arrhythmia
and to prevent muscle fatigue.
7.  Nutrition:  We are giving her tube feeds via her PEG
tube.  We will check her albumin.
8.  Heme/Onc:  The patient is anticoagulated on Aspirin and
Coumadin will be started.
9.  Anemia:  Patient's low blood hematocrit was improving
until yesterday with a hematocrit of 32.
10. Oncology:  Unclear what follow-up will be with her
oncologist.
11. Neuro:  The patient has a history of delirium
intermittent through ICU course.  We will try to avoid
narcotics and Benzo.  The patient has an A line and a PEG
tube and we would favor placing a PICC line for long-term
weaning and antibiotics.  Patient's PCP is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3306**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11568**].  Her health care proxy is [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 36924**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92813**].  Her [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5059**] is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**].
Prophylaxis, patient is on tube feeds and subcu Heparin.  The
patient is a full code and we will readdress this issue as
needed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since [**2120-8-15**] - the patient was found to
have +4 gram positive rods on bronchial washings.  Blood
cultures showed no growth times two bottles and C. diff was
negative.  The patient was placed on Clindamycin 600 mg IV,
she is now on day #4 and is on Levaquin 500 mg each day, she
is on day #6.  The patient will be discharged with a
prescription for a total of 14 days of both antibiotics for
her suspected pneumonia.  The patient had a CT of her chest
which showed a left pleural effusion.  Patient's ventilation
status improved over the course of the last four days.  The
patient was able to off the ventilator for 8 hours yesterday
and just be on the trach mask.  The patient tolerated this
well with an O2 saturation of 99%.  The patient was also seen
by PT, OT and was able to walk to the nurses station and back
with a responsive O2 saturation of 99%.  The patient is
currently on pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5, total
volume in the 300's on an FIO2 of 40%.  The patient's
arterial blood gas today was 7.41 PH, 56 CO2 and 97 for
oxygen.  The patient reports no difficulty breathing and no
difficulty being off the ventilator.  The patient was put
back on ventilator overnight.  She had a brief episode of
hypotension which responded to 250 cc of normal saline bolus.
The patient continues on the Amiodarone for history of atrial
fibrillation.  The patient is now in sinus rhythm.  The
patient was seen by interventional radiology to have a PICC
line placed for long-term IV antibiotics.  Patient's
hematocrit is stable at 27, up from 26.1 measured on [**8-20**].

Date of Birth:   [**2110-8-12**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Gold Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old
male with a known right lower lobe lung cancer who presented
to the Thoracic Surgery Service as a same-day admission on
[**2173-4-21**].  In the Preoperative Holding Area the patient
was noted to have some significant nausea and vomiting as
well as diarrhea.  The patient had originally been planned
for a right lower lobectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].  Due to the
patient's gastrointestinal distress, the case was cancelled.
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Service for
evaluation and treatment of possible gastroenteritis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right lower lobe lung cancer.
2.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Laparotomy status post gunshot wound
to the belly.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Lotensin 5 mg p.o. q. day

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker and heavy
alcohol user.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was in no apparent distress, afebrile, vital signs stable,
normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric.  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Chest was significant for bilateral rales with
minimal wheezing.  Belly was soft with some mild
periumbilical tenderness, no guarding and no rebound.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 62 year old male initially
admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service after a cancelled
right lower lobe lobectomy for a cancer operation secondary
to presumed gastroenteritis.

On hospital day #3, on the Thoracic Surgical Service, the
patient was noted to have a possible partial small bowel
obstruction or ileus on KUB until nasogastric tube was placed
to low continuous wall suction.  On [**2173-4-25**], the
General Surgery Gold Service was consulted for further
evaluation and treatment of small bowel obstruction.  The
patient was evaluated and it was determined that the patient
had probable complete small bowel obstruction.  The patient
was made NPO and nasogastric tube was continued on suction.
The patient was planned for exploratory laparotomy and
possible lysis of adhesions.  On [**2173-4-26**], the patient
was taken to the Operating Room for said operation.
Intraoperatively the patient was noted to have massively
dilated small bowel obstructed by a knot of adhesions within
the mesentery with omentum wrapped around the distal ileum.
Approximately 7.5 liters of enteric contents were evacuated
from an enterotomy.  The case was complicated by question of
+/- aspiration.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively where he remained intubated and sedated.
Immediately postoperatively the patient was on Milrinone and
Levophed as well as remaining on the ventilator.  The patient
was also started on ............ on postoperative day #2.
The patient was also begun on Zosyn and Fluconazole
antibiotics.  On postoperative day #3, the patient was weaned
off of most drips and the last drip to be weaned was the
Levophed.  The patient remained sedated.  Propofol was
stopped as he had a pump prn Morphine.  On postoperative day
#4, the patient was weaned off of the vent, weaned to
extubation.  The patient was off all pressors at this time.

The patient was eventually extubated on postoperative day #6,
[**2173-5-2**], also during this time the patient was
diuresing very well with the help of some intermittent
intravenous Lasix.  The patient continued to do well after
extubation.  Prior to being transferred to the floor the
patient was bronchoscoped on [**2173-5-5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and
a thick clear secretion as aspirated from the right
middle/lower lobe.  The patient was eventually transferred to
the floor on postoperative day #13.  The patient was doing
well, tolerating a regular diet.  Ambulation was somewhat
impaired seeing that the patient was severely deconditioned
and otherwise the patient was doing very well.

On [**2173-5-12**], the patient was deemed well enough to go
to rehabilitation.  The patient was recommended in this
capacity for rehabilitation by physical therapy evaluation.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right lower lobe lung cancer.
2.  Small bowel obstruction.
3.  Status post exploratory laparotomy.
4.  Question of aspiration pneumonia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
one to two weeks, is to call for an appointment, and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in one to two weeks, please call for an appointment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

Date of Birth:  [**2110-8-12**]        Sex:  M

Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
male with a history of right lower lobe stage III, non-small-
cell lung cancer of the squamous type who has had two cycles
of induction chemotherapy initiated on [**2172-12-22**] and
radiation therapy times six weeks.

The patient was planning to have a surgical resection on
[**2173-4-26**] but developed a small bowel obstruction
requiring an emergent exploratory laparotomy.  Two bowel
perforations were found, and postoperatively the patient was
sick and in the Intensive Care Unit with evidence of a septic
physiology.  He was discharged to rehabilitation at that time
and was home for three weeks prior to his current admission.
He gained about five pounds per week over those weeks, and
his appetite was much improved.  He has an occasional dry
cough and reports that he had pneumonia while in the
rehabilitation facility; however, his breathing is quite
good.

Repeat scans showed increased activity within the tumor and
within the right hilar and right paratracheal lymph nodes.
This was quite concerning given that the induction
chemoradiotherapy did not eradicate lymphatic involvement and
that it is progressing rapidly.  The patient was thought to
have a poor prognosis despite the addition of surgical
therapy; but nonetheless, after discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]
and the patient's wife, the patient opted for further
surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right lower lobe stage III non-small-
cell lung cancer of the squamous type; status post radiation
therapy and chemotherapy.

Hypertension.

History of a small-bowel obstruction.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Exploratory laparotomy/lysis of
adhesions.

Anal sphincterotomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Metoprolol 100 mg twice per day.
2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg once per day.
3. Protonix 40 mg once per day.
4. Percocet.
5. Megace.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general,  the
patient appeared well.  Thinner than usual but walked without
difficulty.  Vital signs revealed his temperature was 98.6,
his heart rate was 100, his blood pressure was 130/80, his
respiratory rate was 18, and 98 percent on room air.  Weight
was 163 pounds.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
The sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx was clear.  The
neck was supple.  No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, or
axillary lymph nodes.  Chest revealed occasional expiratory
wheezes.  Good air movement.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft and
nontender.  A well-healed surgical scar.  A small opening in
the inferior umbilical area.  Extremities were thin.  No
edema or asymmetric swelling.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 10.1, his hematocrit was 33.9, and his
platelets were 218.  Sodium was 137, blood urea nitrogen was
11, and his creatinine was 1.1.  His albumin was 3.7.  His
calcium was 9.6.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-6-23**] the patient
underwent a right pneumonectomy, a radical mediastinal lymph
node dissection with a muscle flap.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  The intraoperative course was
complicated by recurrent hypotension into the low 60s.  The
patient had an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
which showed multiple areas of hypokinesis with tricuspid
regurgitation, right ventricular dilatation, and an ejection
fraction of 40 percent.  However, this was no change from
preoperatively.  Please see the dictated operative note for
further details.

Postoperatively, the patient remained hypotensive with a
blood pressure of 94/62 on a Neo-Synephrine drip.  The
patient remained intubated.  The patient was ultimately
extubated on postoperative day three without incident.
Postoperatively, cardiac enzymes were drawn and the CK/MB
fraction was found to range from 3 to 5 postoperatively with
a troponin of 0.06.

Also, on postoperative day one, the patient's temperature
spiked to 102.6.  The patient had blood, urine, and sputum
cultures sent.  The blood and urine cultures ultimately came
back negative, but the sputum culture later grew out
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  As a
consequence, the patient was placed on vancomycin and was
transitioned to linezolid on discharge for a total of a 10-
day course.

On postoperative day two, the patient's chest tube was
removed but he continued to require Neo-Synephrine to
maintain his blood pressure at 99/57.  His pulse remained
high at 109, and his hematocrit slowly drifted down from a
preoperative value of 37.8 to 25.9 on postoperative day
three; at which point the patient received a transfusion of 1
unit of packed red blood cells.  Following this transfusion,
the patient's hematocrit bumped to the 28 to 29 range where
it remained stable for the remainder of his hospital course.

By postoperative day three, the patient's epidural was taken
out and he was started on a morphine patient-controlled
analgesia.  He was able to come off the Neo-Synephrine, and
his blood pressure was maintained at 137/70.  Diuresis was
begun with Lasix, and the patient was receiving aggressive
chest physical therapy.

On postoperative day five, the patient was switched to oral
pain medications.  Chest physical therapy was continued, and
the patient was begun on Lopressor for his tachycardia.  The
patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital course
following his initial temperature spikes in the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient was transferred to the floor late on
postoperative day five.

On postoperative day six, the patient continued to require
aggressive chest physical therapy for his coarse breath
sounds and a productive cough.  His metoprolol dose was
increased ultimately to 100 mg by mouth twice per day.

On postoperative day seven, the patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility with a 7-day course of linezolid and
recommendation that the patient receive aggressive chest
physical therapy and frequent walking.  On the day of
discharge, the patient continued to have rhonchi on the left
with a productive cough; however, his oxygen saturations were
good at 97 percent on 2 liters with a respiratory rate of 20.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Identical to the admission diagnoses
listed in the Past Medical History with the addition of the
following:  Status post right pneumonectomy, radical
mediastinal lymph node dissection and muscle flap on [**2173-6-23**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Linezolid 600 mg by mouth twice per day (times seven
   days).
2. Percocet 5/325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth q.4-
   6h. as needed.
3. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
4. Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Furosemide 20 mg by mouth twice per day.
6. Ipratropium bromide 2 puffs inhaled four times per day.
7. Metoprolol 100 mg by mouth twice per day.

pneumomediastinum.
FINDINGS: AP single view with patient in upright sitting
position has been obtained. There are extensive central
pulmonary infiltrates on the right side, a lesser degree also in
the central portion of the left lung. In addition, multiple
round densities are disseminated in both lungs and suggest the
possibility of secondary metastatic deposits. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum on this single AP
view chest examination. A chest CT was performed earlier during
the same day, but previous chest examinations are not available
so that direct comparison can be performed.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2193-12-3**] 12:36 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with questionable RUL mass with h/o hemoptysis

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval RUL mass
INDICATION: Hemoptysis. Questionable right upper lobe mass.
History of breast cancer.

No prior chest radiographs or chest CT scans are available for
comparison. Comparison is made to CT abdomen of [**2191-3-2**].

Multidetector CT of the chest was performed following
intravenous administration of 65 cc of Optiray. Images were
presented for display in the axial plane at 5 mm and 1.25 mm
collimation.

Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are present involving all
lobes of both lungs. These range in size from less than 1 cm to
several cm in diameter. On thin section images, the vast
majority of the nodules have spiculated and lobulated margins.
Though most of the lesions measure less than 3 cm in diameter, a
dominant mass in the lateral segment right middle lobe measures
3.1 cm x 2.4 cm (image 139, series 102). In addition to the
multiple nodules and mass, there are multilobar areas of
ground-glass attenuation within the lungs as well as
geographically marginated areas of consolidation in the
perihilar and paramediastinal portions of the lungs, worse on
the right than the left. Inferiorly, below the level of the
right hilum, the geographically marginated opacities traverse
the fissure in an non-anatomic distribution that is suggestive
of radiation therapy pneumonitis. However, at a higher level,
the opacities are sharply demarcated by the fissure. Additional
findings include smooth septal thickening with diffuse
distribution but most pronounced in the lower lobes and lung
apices, right greater than left. Thickening is present along the
walls of the central airways, particularly the bronchus
intermedius and right upper lobe bronchi posteriorly.

Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is present. Additionally, there
are several prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes measuring
less than 1 cm in greatest short axis dimension, which do not
meet strict criteria for enlargement. The heart size is normal.
A small pericardial effusion is present. Small right pleural
effusion is present as well.

In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, extrarenal pelves
are present bilaterally in the kidneys. Adrenal glands are
stable in appearance compared to the prior CT abdomen study with
no evidence of suspicious lesions to suggest adrenal metastases.
Heterogeneous appearance of the spleen is likely due to phase of
contrast. Please note that the examination was not specifically
tailored for evaluating the abdominal organs.

There has been prior right mastectomy.

Skeletal structures demonstrate several healed right rib
fractures with marked callus formation. Healing or healed lower
left rib fractures are also noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with spiculated and
lobulated margins. Dominant 3.1 cm mass in right middle lobe
with similar morphology to other lesions. In a patient with
history of breast cancer, this may be due to widespread
metastatic disease. Primary lung cancer with metastatic lesions
and diffuse fungal infection are considered less likely.
2. Extensive areas of consolidation with geographic margins in
the perihilar and paramediastinal portions of both lungs. Some
of these traverse the fissure and could potentially reflect
radiation pneumonitis, but coexisting infection, hemorrhage, or
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is also possible. Correlation
with the portal would be helpful.
3. Multifocal ground-glass opacities and septal thickening.
Differential diagnosis includes interstitial pulmonary edema,
drug toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage, and lymphangitic
carcinomatosis.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and borderline right
paratracheal lymph nodes.
6. If available, direct comparison to prior CT scans would be
helpful to determine change from prior exams.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MR THORACIC SPINE  [**2153-6-7**] 6:59 PM

MR THORACIC SPINE

Reason: please assess for cord compression

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 YO W with metastatic lung cancer with known T7 spinal lesion
now presents with lower extremity weakness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess for cord compression
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 59-year-old with metastatic lung cancer and known T7
spinal lesion. Assess for cord compression.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images through the
thoracic spine without IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2153-3-30**].

There is a large right upper lobe lung mass measuring at least
3.6 x 6.2 cm on scout images. This is consistent with the
patient's known history of lung cancer.

Compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body has progressed
since the prior examination now with marked retropulsion of
fragments and increased soft tissue mass associated with
increased compression of spinal cord. Soft tissue is seen
extending into and essentially obliterating the left neural
foramen and pressing upon the spinal cord causing
moderate-to-severe cord compression. No increased STIR signal
intensity or T2 signal intensity is seen within the cord to
suggest cord edema. Soft tissue mass is also seen extending into
the right neural foramen, but to a lesser extent than the left.

A new linear area along the superior aspect of the T4 vertebral
body is seen, demonstrating decreased T1 and increased STIR
signal intensity. A new 7 x 7 mm rounded somewhat ill-defined
lesion is seen in the posterior right aspect of the T6 vertebral
body concerning for a new metastatic static focus. Decreased T1
signal intensity along the inferior endplate of T6 likely is due
to degenerative changes. Heterogeneously decreased T1 and
increased T2/STIR signal intensity throughout the T8 vertebral
body is also seen and new from the prior examination. There is
also mild-to-moderate anterior wedging of the T8 vertebral body,
also new since the prior study. There has been slightly
increased diffuse T1 signal intensity throughout the vertebral
bodies in the thoracic spine likely related to post-radiation
changes.

Elsewhere in the thoracic spine, the spinal canal appears normal
in caliber. Vertebral body alignment is also normal elsewhere as
is vertebral body height and disc space height.

IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of metastatic disease involving T8 with increased
collapse of the vertebral body and soft tissue component
involving the vertebral body. There is extension of soft tissue
component into both neural foramen, left greater than right, and
moderate-to-severe cord compression without definite cord edema.

2. Probable new metastatic focus in T6 posteriorly on the right.

3. Post-radiation changes throughout the thoracic spine. Signal
abnormalities in the T4 vertebral body is probably due to
insufficiency fracture post-radiation. Signal abnormalities in
T8 are less certain and may be due to new metastatic involvement
or insufficiency fracture.

4. Known right upper lobe lung cancer.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 59 yo F NSCLC who presented with lower extremity
weakness and was found to haver thoracic cord compression
secondary to her know metastatic lung cancer.
.
The patient has a known T7 metastasis which was previously
treated with XRT. Her MRI on admission demonstrated worsening
cord compression. She was not a a candidate for XRT and thus was
transferred to neurosurgery for laminectomy and decompression.
As part of her pre-op her ASA and heparin were d/c'ed. An Xray
was checked which demonstrated mild tracheal deviation but upon
discussion with the radiologist this was thought to be unchanged
from previous. She was continued on dexamethasone 4 mg IV q 6
hrs and placed on an insulin sliding scale.  As part of her
pre-op clearance she was seen by anesthesia.

Patient seen and evaluated by neurosurgery for palliative
resection of T7 lesion and instrumentation. After long
discussion with patient and his oncologist further decided to
proceed with surgery. Patient transferred to neuropsurgery
service and taken to OR on [**6-10**] under general anesthesia for T7
metastatic lesion resection and T4-10 fusion and instrumentation
and facia JP drainplacement without intraoperative
complications. Patient tranferred to neuro ICU immediate postop
for further close monitoring. She remainedintubated overnight
able extuabte succesfully in the morning of postop day one.

Immediate postoperative neurologic exam is she was able follow
commands moving all atremities, able to lift both upper and
lower extremities, sensation intact. Her hematoctrit dropped
29.9 to 23.3 on the postoperative day one which she received one
unit of PRBC, subsequent hct levels are improved. She was some
what tachycardic tried to control with beta-blockers, was on
pressors was able to wean off on postop day one.
Patient transferred to step-down on postop day one in the
afternoon. He tachyacardia was better conrrolled, remained
afebrile. She continued to improve, TLSO brace fitted for
fusion. She transferred to floor status on day two, JP drain
removed, her insicion site dry and clean, no redness or swelling
noted. Her Thoracis PA/lateral radiogaraph reveals posterior
fixation rods are seen. Pedicles screws are seen from T4-5 and
T10-11 levels. Two contiguous mid thoracic compression fractures
are visualized. A large consolidation/mass is present in the
right upper lobe of the lung. There is normal alignment of the
thoracic spine.
Patient fitted for TLSO brace which is at her bed side. Patient
seen and evaluated by PT and recommendd rehabilitition.

.
Her INR was elevated upon admission for unclear reasons.  She
was on coumadin in the past but her primary oncologist thought
that this had been stopped. Persual of her [**Month (only) 16**] from the nursing
home did not demonstrate the administration of coumadin.  She
received a total of 10mg Vit K SC and 10mg Vit K PO.
.
For the patients NSCLC, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is holding tarceva for now. The
patient will have a CT torso for tumor staging post-operatively.
The patient received duonebs for shortness of breath and
congestion.
.
She was continued on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism which is
stable. For anxiety she received imipramine and remeron. We
avoided administration of ativan as she has had some paradoxical
side effects.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 7474**] received potassium repletion of 40mEq PO x 2, 40mEq
IV x 1. Her subsequent chemistry showed correction of her
potassium.
.
Fludrocort was administered for apparent mineralcorticoid
deficiency. Iron supplementation was continued for treatment of
anemia.
.
The patient had a previously documented DNR/DNI status, but
currently requests only DNI, and 1 set of chest compressions.
She will discuss this further with her primary attending.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
male with history of diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, CAD, ventricular tachycardia, status
post implantable defibrillator with newly diagnosed right
upper lobe [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for
right main stem bronchus stent for recurrent ex vacuo
effusion, status post thoracentesis times three.  The patient
was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2200-2-17**], with
ventricular tachycardia following a motor vehicle accident.
An implantable defibrillator was placed at that time.  He was
then readmitted on [**2200-3-26**], for a recurrent pleural
effusion, for which he received a pigtail catheter and
consideration of possible pleurodesis.  However, he was not a
candidate for pleurodesis secondary to the pleural effusion
ex vacuo.  Thus CT surgery placed a chest tube, which was
accidentally pulled out by the patient during movement on
[**2200-3-30**].  On [**2200-4-4**], the patient became
acutely short of breath with drop in sense requiring non-
rebreather.  Further decompensation occurred while the
patient was transferred to the CCU and he ultimately required
emergent intubation.  Pre-intubation gas 7.42/41/79.  The
patient's blood pressure decreased following intubation
requiring IV fluids and Neo-Synephrine.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a right main stem bronchus shunt to
hopefully resolve his pleural effusion ex vacuo, which was
thought to be secondary to right lobar collapse secondary to
his obstruction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, CAD status
post MI in [**2197**], status post LAD stent, catheterization in
[**2194**] showed three-vessel disease with 50 percent narrowing of
the LAD, 30 percent narrowing of the proximal SARC and 60
percent narrowing of the marginal branch.  Echo in [**2198-11-18**], showed an EF of 50 percent, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; and a
normal pulmonary artery pressure, history of ventricular
tachycardia status post implantable defibrillator, right
upper lobe mass diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, no
endobronchial disease on bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital1 336**] (status
post pleuracentesis, fluid was non malignant, MRI revealed
mediastinal involvement, thus the patient was considered non-
resectable; status post 12 radiation treatments in addition
to a course of Paxil and carboplatin), hypercholesterolemia,
and history of atrial fibrillation, taken off Coumadin four
weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Avandia 4 mg p.o. q.p.m.
2. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.p.m.
3. Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4. Megace 100 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother was deceased in his 50s secondary to
lung cancer with positive history of tobacco, multiple
members with early CAD.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is positive tobacco, 0.5 packs
per day times 50 years, no alcohol, and worked as a fish
cutter in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.2, blood pressure
72/25 with a CVP of four, and heart rate of 65.  The patient
is on AC with a tidal volume of 600 and respiratory rate of
14, with a PIP of 5, FIO2 of 60 percent, with an O2
saturation of 95 percent.  ABG was 7.43/31/75.  In general,
the patient is intubated, sedated in no apparent distress.
Skin, no rash.  HEENT, pupils are equally round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Sclerae anicteric.
Cardiovascular, bradycardia with regular rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary, coarse breath sounds on the
left, poor air movement on the right.  Abdomen, normoactive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities, 1 to 2 plus pitting edema
in the upper extremities, left greater than the right, no
clubbing or cyanosis.  Neurologically, alert, follows
commands, strength 4/4 bilaterally in the upper and lower
extremities, 1 plus reflexes bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA AND DIAGNOSTICS:  White count is 3.9,
hematocrit 32.2, platelets 88 with 86 percent neutrophils, 12
percents lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes.  Sodium is
136, potassium 4.5, bicarbonate 20, BUN 59, creatinine 1.7,
and lactate 1.2.  EKG, paced at 66 beats per minute, left
bundle branch block, questionable new T-wave inversion in V5-
V6.  Chest x-ray, right upper lobe collapse, positive
atelectasis/wide-out of the remainder of the right lung.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75-year-old male with a history
of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD status
post MI and LAD stent, ventricular tachycardia status post
defibrillator, transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for
right main stem bronchus stent for obstructing right lung
mass, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma complicated by an
ex vacuo pleural effusion.

Right lung mass.  The patient presents with a diagnosis of
non-small cell lung cancer identified as stage 3B squamous
carcinoma with mediastinal involvement by MRI with a non-
malignant ex vacuo pleural effusion and associated lung
collapse, status post 12 radiation treatments and a course of
Paxil and carboplatin.  Plan for an initial right main stem
bronchus stent, however, bronchoscopy revealed multiple
endobronchial lesions, thus be more appropriate treatment was
thought to be photodynamic therapy.  The patient was
activated with photodynamic therapy on [**2200-4-10**].  He
required three subsequent bronchoscopies for removal of
debridement from the right main stem bronchus.
Unfortunately, his lung did not re-expand following this
intervention and the patient passed before any significant
recovery could occur.  During his hospital stay, hematology-
oncology was consulted to discuss further management as
daughter looking to shift care to [**Hospital1 18**].  Discussion
initially was made of further chemotherapy.  Radiation
oncology was consulted and felt no further radiation was
indicated as the patient has progressed through 12 treatments
of radiation.  However, the patient, as stated earlier,
passed before recovery from his immediate ailment.

Right pleural effusion ex vacuo.  The patient presented with
a right chest tube in place.  The chest tube remained water
sealed.  Our hope was that this chest tube could be removed
following the re-expansion of his lungs after intervention to
open up his right main stem bronchus.  Unfortunately, his
lung did not re-expand and the chest tube remained in place
at the time of his death.

Respiratory failure.  Due to the patient's obstructing mass
leading to a pleural effusion ex vacuo, the patient suffered
hypoxic respiratory failure.  At the outside hospital, a
chest tube was placed.  It was accidentally dislodged, but
ultimately required replacement as the patient had
respiratory decompensation.  He was transferred, intubated on
assist control.  He was tried on pressor-support during the
course of his ICU stay.  However, he was unable to be weaned
from the ventilator.

Hypotension.  The patient presented with blood pressure of
72/25 with a CVP of four on peripheral Neo-Synephrine.  His
hypotension was initially thought to be due to decreased pre-
loads secondary to increased inter-chest pressures from his
pleural effusion ex vacuo and positive pressure ventilation.
His cortisol was found to be within normal limits.  His blood
pressure did respond to p.r.n. fluid boluses.  He was
maintained on Neo-Synephrine.  During the course of his stay
Vasopressin was added to further support his blood pressures.
The patient's condition began to decompensate.  During this
hospital stay, the patient became septic from likely
pulmonary source and required increasing amounts of pressors
for support.  He ceased to respond to IV fluid boluses and
pressor-support was thought to be maximized.  The patient was
maintained on all these medications till the time of his
death.

Cardiovascular.

Ischemia.  The patient's beta-blocker was held due to his
hypotension. Troponins were slightly elevated at level of
0.05; however, CK MB remained negative, and EKG unchanged.

Rhythm.  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and
ventricular tachycardia, but was paced at a rate of 66 on
presentation and remained in sinus.

Pump.  The patient had significant amount of third spacing;
however, no evidence of obvious heart failure.  His EF was
noted to be 35 to 40 percent.

Upper extremity edema.  The patient presented with bilateral
upper extremity edema, left greater than right; bilateral
Dopplers were negative for DVT.  This was thought to be
secondary to third spacing from aggressive fluid
resuscitation.

Neutropenic fever.  The patient with low-grade fever in the
setting of neutropenia.  Thus, he was started on empiric
ceftazidime.  Vancomycin was later added for persistent
hypotension, but was subsequently discontinued when the
patient was able to be weaned off all pressors.  The patient
was administered GCSF in hopes of recovering his white blood
count and this medication was discontinued when he was no
longer neutropenic.  Unfortunately, the patient developed
worsening functions.  Sputum culture grew Gram-negative rods
with moderate Haemophilus.  He was thus continued on his
ceftazidime and vancomycin was restarted in addition to Cipro
for double-pseudomonas coverage.  Unfortunately, the patient
subsequently developed a copious amounts of diarrhea, and was
empirically treated for C. Diff. colitis, subsequent toxins
were positive.  He was continued on Flagyl and his diarrhea
subsided.  KUB was assessed during the course of his ICU stay
and was negative for toxic megacolon.  The patient continued
to deteriorate.  His coagulase were increased.  He was
administered vitamin K and DIC panel was negative.  An ID
consult was obtained and on [**2200-4-13**], mucolytic
cultures were then growing yeast.  The patient was thus
started on AmBisome, which was changed to IV fluconazole upon
the identification of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 564**] leukopenia in the patient's
blood.  Ultimately, the patient's ceftazidime was
discontinued secondary to drop in platelets and eminent death
as this medication was thought to be doing more harm than
good.

Acute renal failure.  The patient presented with elevated
creatinine.  His renal function worsened in the first few
days of his ICU admission.  A FENA at the time was 0.3
percent.  His creatinine came down with IV fluids and his
urine output responded to fluid boluses.  However, later in
his ICU stay, his creatinine again rose.  Urine eos were
negative.  Protein to creatinine was 1.0; FENA at that time
was 0.9 percent with urine output of 423.  The patient's
progressive worsening renal failure was thought to be due to
HEN and secondary to hypotension and sepsis.  His creatinine
reached as high as 4.2.

Diabetes.  The patient was initially on a sliding scale
insulin, however, he was quickly changed to an insulin drug
for improved blood sugar control.

Prophylaxis.  The patient maintained on PPI, subcutaneous
Heparin, and neutropenic precautions.

FEN.  The patient's nutritional status maintained with tube
feeds.  Nutrition followed and provided guidance along the
way.

Code status.  As the patient rapidly declined near the end of
his stay, despite attempted intervention and photodynamic
therapy to improve his overall outcome, a number of family
meetings were organized to discuss the patient's wishes
regarding further intervention.  His daughter had significant
difficulties with the decision making.  Ethics was consulted
to aid and supporting her and making these difficult
decisions.  Multiple staff were uncomfortable with perceived
discomfort on the part of the patient.  It was the opinion of
ethics that we would continue to support the daughter's
wishes as likely this gentleman would desire that, and the
daughter did come to a point at which she began to withdraw
care.  Please see death certificate for the date and time of

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46
year old male who had several episodes of post obstructive
pneumonia in the past secondary to a lingular mass which was
discovered via flexible bronchoscopy.  It was noted to be an
obstructive tumor in the orifice of the lingula.  Several
biopsies of these lesions proved to be non-diagnostic.  He
was referred to Thoracic Surgery for more definitive
evaluation of this via rigid bronchoscopy with debridement of
the endobronchial mass which would allow alleviation of the
post-obstructive pneumonia and better pathology examination
of the specimens.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, he was in no acute distress.
Sclerae were anicteric.  Vital signs were within normal
limits.  There was no cervical adenopathy.  The lungs were
both clear bilaterally.  The heart was regular without
murmur.  The thorax was symmetrical without masses.  Abdomen
was obese without masses.  The extremities revealed no
clubbing or edema.  There were no telangiectasias on the skin
and neurologically the patient was non-focal.

LABORATORY:  In terms of admitting labs, the hematocrit was
noted to be 36.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**2130-8-16**].
That same day he underwent bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy,
left upper lobectomy and a lingulectomy with a left
thoracotomy.  There was no note of operative complication.
Estimated blood loss was only 150 cc.  Notably, this patient
was difficult to intubate preoperatively, therefore, given
his respiratory status and difficult airways, it was
determined that the patient remained intubated overnight as
the surgery ended at a late hour.

He remained in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit during
postoperative day one, on which the morning of he was
extubated without difficulty.  He was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day two without any notable
complications and immediately began ambulating and continuing
with the rest of the chest Physical Therapy and pulmonary
toilet.

He did develop some problems with atelectasis at the left
base but with aggressive pulmonary toilet, this too did clear
and the patient had his chest tubes discontinued on [**8-19**]
after which the epidural and Foley was subsequently
discontinued and the patient was switched to p.o. pain
medications which he tolerated well.

The patient was set for discharge on postoperative day five
with no notable pain issues any longer and a good
respiratory status.

LABORATORY:  At the time of discharge his hematocrit was
31.6.

He was discharged in good condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  He was asked to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in one week.

Pathology of his diagnosis is still currently pending.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q. six hours as needed.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets every six hours as needed.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Verapamil 180 mg p.o. q. day.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Endobronchial mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Excision/Destruction RUL endobronchial mass, removal of foreign
body.


History of Present Illness:
76M with hx of LUL resection for NSCLC 30 years ago who
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with massive hemoptysis on
[**2160-9-5**]. At that time, he was intubated for airway protection
and on bronchoscopy, he was found to have an obstruction lesion
of the right mainstem due to a RUL tumor. At that time, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2160-9-9**] for a rigid and flexible
bronchscopy where they found that the right mainstem was
approximately 80-90% obstructed by a tumor mass coming from the
right upper lobe. They found foreign bodies which appeared to be
suture material and perhaps a fingernail in that area which was
sent to pathology as well, prompting a possible diagnosis of
foreign body granuloma. They performed multiple biopsies of the
friable mass. Following the biopsies, the tumor was destroyed
with electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation. However, they
were not able to achieve patency of the right upper lobe
bronchus. The right mainstem was completely patent at the end of
the procedure. He was then sent to the SICU where he was
extubated without event. He had a video swallow which showed no
evidence of aspiration.
.
Of note, he originally presented to PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] month of cough
and shortness of breath. He was treated emperically with abx
with no resolution of the mass on cxr, which prompted the
bronchoscopy at [**Location (un) **].
.
At baseline, he can walk 4 blocks without getting SOB.

CXR: No comparison exams at this facility. Satisfactorily
positioned ET tube in distal trachea 3 cm from carina. No
discrete bronchial lesion identified, although the right main
stem bronchus is not visualized. The superior mediastinum is
obscured with no discrete margination of its lateral borders,
and there is slight prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary
markings. No discrete lung mass and no vascular congestion or
consolidations. I doubt the presence of effusions, although the
right lateral CP angle is not imaged. Heart normal size. NG tube
looped in stomach. Slightly elevated left hemidiaphragm. No lung
nodules or bone destruction identified.

BRONCH RUL BX:
Right upper lobe mass, biopsy: Undifferentiated large cell
carcinoma.

CYTOLOGY RUL MASS:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.

MRI HEAD:
No evidence of intracranial metastasis.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS:
1. Appearance raising concern for the possibility of a pulmonary
embolus in a right lower lobe branch of the right pulmonary
artery, although indeterminate. this finding was discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] at 11 pm on the day of the study.
2. Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Bibasilar mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities,
which given their recent onset, are most suspicious for an
infection, inflammation, or in the appropriate clinical setting,
hemorrhage.
4. Marked scarring and emphysema in the right upper lobe.
5. Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, for which short-term followup
is recommended.
6. Several subcentimeter vague hypoattenuating foci in the liver
which are nonspecific. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded.
7. Large 3-4 cm nonspecific lesion in the spleen. To evaluate
the significance of this finding, further correlation with prior
studies could be most helpful.
8. A 13 mm lesion along the lower pole of the left kidney with
indeterminate characteristics and too small to characterize
here. It could be helpful to use an ultrasound to determine
whether this definitely represents a mildly dense cyst, if
clinically indicated.

CTA CHEST:
1. Filling defects within the arterial pulmonary vasculature
within the superior portion of the right lower lobe consistent
with pulmonary embolism. Etiology could include primary embolus
versus tumor thrombus.
2. Mixed ground glass and consolidative opacities seen by
bibasilarly. Unchanged compared to the previous study.
3. Unchanged emphysematous changes.
4. Unchanged right hilar mass.
5. Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

BONE SCAN:
No definite evidence for osseous metastases.

LENIS:
No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76M with hx of LUL resection for NSCLC presents with
hemoptysis and found to have RUL mass with obstruction of right
mainstem.
.
# HEMOPTYSIS: He did not have any hemopytsis during his hospital
course here.
.
# NSCLC: s/p resection of LUL 30 years ago.  On this admission,
s/p rigid brochoscopy with laser ablation of RUL mass.
Pathology and cytology from biopsy shows undifferentiated large
cell carcinoma.  Heme/Onc was called for consultation.  He
received staging scans.  Head MRI was negative for mets.  Chest
CT showed mediastinal and right hilar LAD.  Abd CT showed 3-4cm
lesion in spleen and non-specific lesions in liver.  His bone
scan was negative.  He will get a PET scan for staging as an
outpatient.  He is scheduled for an outpatient follow up with
[**Hospital **] clinic at BIMDC on [**10-2**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1058**].  He
will also follow up with Interventional Pulmonology and CT
Surgery as an outpatient, appointments already scheduled.
.
# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  He has a RLL PE by CTA.  His malignancy
probably put him at an increased risk for PE.  He will need to
be on Levonox 60mg [**Hospital1 **].  He need to follow up with his primary
care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] clinic and pulmonary clinic.
.
# POST-OBSTRUCTIVE PNA:  He has radiographic opacities on chest
CT which could be infectious or could be hemorrhage from RUL
ablation (reviewed with radiology).  He will finish his course
of antibiotics: levoquin and flagyl.  He will also need to
finish his steroid taper.  At discharge, he was able to ambulate
comfortably with 2LNC.  He will continue to use oxygen
supplement at home as needed.
.
# COPD: He should continue his albuterol and ipratroprium nebs,
and advair for long acting steroids.
.
# HTN: Continue outpt metoprolol.  Hctz was added on this
admission for further bp lowering.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for a stent for a right
mainstem bronchus obstruction with squamous cell carcinoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old female
admitted to [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital from [**5-30**] through [**6-18**]
for dyspnea which was felt secondary to congestive heart
failure.

She was treated for congestive heart failure first as a
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare during that time
and was discharged on [**6-18**].

On [**6-19**], she returned to the hospital because of some
right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Chest x-ray showed a
density at the right base with right mediastinal shift.  A CT
of the chest showed complete collapse of the right lower lobe
secondary to an endobronchial lesion.

There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There was also
no evidence of any pleural or pericardial effusion.  She also
reportedly had some mediastinal adenopathy and a right hilar
mass, reported visible on chest x-rays from [**2106-9-19**],
with indeterminate follow-up mediastinoscopy.

She was admitted at that point on [**6-19**] for bronchoscopy for
biopsy of the right mainstem endobronchial lesion.  The
pathology returned that day positive for squamous cell
carcinoma.

The patient was accepted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of Interventional
Pulmonology here at [**Hospital6 256**] for
bronchoscopy and intervention, and the patient was
transferred on [**6-21**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is a 1?????? pack-per-day smoker for 45
years until stopping one year ago.  She denied alcohol.  She
lives with her husband and has two sons and one daughter.
She is a retired clerk.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On presentation
temperature was 97.6??????, heart rate 95, blood pressure 170/48,
respirations 20.  General:  She was an intubated and obese
woman in no apparent distress, but anxious.  She was
attempting to communicate verbally while intubated.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx moist.
Chest:  Clear breath sounds on the left but coarse breath
sounds on the right superiorly, with absent breath sounds
inferiorly.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2.  Without murmurs.  Abdomen:  Obese.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  There was mild, chronic venostasis changes
without any peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  From [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital white count was
20.2, hematocrit 45.3, platelet count 209; CHEM7 with a
sodium of 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 98, bicarb 30, BUN 22,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 189; LFTs were unremarkable.

Chest x-ray done at the outside revealed volume loss, likely
postobstructive collapse involving the right lung with
associated atelectasis.

Chest CT done on [**6-19**] showed complete collapse of the right
lower lobe secondary to endobronchial lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory distress:  This was thought
to be likely due to endobronchial lesion with postlesion
obstruction and collapse of the right lung.  The patient was
oxygenating and ventilating well on a ventilator when she
arrived, and this was kept on those settings on the first
night and switched over to pressure support ventilation.

She received a CT of the airway with reconstruction and
preparation for the rigid interventional bronchoscopy.  She
went to Interventional Bronchoscopy on [**6-22**], which revealed
a mass within the right mainstem bronchus occluding the
origin of the right upper lobe bronchus, measuring
approximately 13 x 9 mm in diameter.

This was excised by Interventional Pulmonology, and the
patient returned to the MICU status post excision without
endobronchial stent.

After the bronchoscopy, she did have six weeks of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  She remained
ventilated with intravenous sedation and was gradually weaned
off and extubated on [**6-23**].

Initially she did have some thick secretions through her
stent which was sent to microbiopsy for speciation, and these
eventually grew out pseudomonas sensitive to everything
except for ...................  She therefore had initially
been started on Zosyn, as well as Levofloxacin and Vancomycin
upon admission for the leukocytosis, and gradually her
antibiotic regimen was narrowed down to just Zosyn for the
pseudomonas pneumonia.  At the time of this dictation, she is
currently on day #7 of a 10-day course of intravenous Zosyn
for the pseudomonas.

After extubation on the 5th, the patient continued to have
some respiratory distress and required face mask, as well as
sedation.  Her arterial blood gases continued to show
adequate ventilation.  Her respiratory distress was felt to
be multifactorial from the pseudomonas pneumonia, the
possible reactive airway disease flare, and flash pulmonary
edema.

She was diuresed gently with a one-time dose of 40 mg Lasix
and also given high-dose steroids and nebulizers to improve
some bronchospastic disease.  She was also felt to be
delirious during this time, and was not tolerating her BIPAP,
which she normally uses at home.

Eventually she became less agitated and was able to tolerate
the face mask with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.  She
was increased on her benzodiazepines, as she did have a
history of taking Xanax more than once a day at home.  She
continued to do well on this regimen, and two days prior to
discharge, she was lucid and oriented and pleasant, doing
well with nasal cannula.

Her lung exam appeared improved with less wheezing and fewer
rhonchi, and her white count decreased to within normal
limits by this time.

On the day before discharge, she was finally able to tolerate
her BIPAP all night, as she does at home, on settings of 14
and 8.  She did not require any further diuresis.

2.  Hypertension and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia:
The patient did have two episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia throughout her whole hospital course which were
six beats and 11 beats in duration.  She had no chest pain.
It is recommended that she follow-up with Cardiology for risk
stratification for coronary artery disease, as she does have
risk factors.

She was kept on Captopril for hypertension at her Lisinopril
dose equivalent.  She was switched on the day of discharge
back to her standing Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Her Digoxin, which was presumably prescribed by her physician
for congestive heart failure, was discontinued for risk of
any arrhythmia affects; however, she was continued on her
Lipitor and Lisinopril.  She may need to restart Lasix at a
future date and should be followed closely by her primary
care physician.

In addition, another medication change that was made was the
discontinuation of Theophylline.  She will be given inhalers
with bronchodilators and inhalers for control of her reactive
airway disease.

She did have two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response which lasted less than a few minutes
each time, resolving spontaneously without medication.  She
was however prescribed Diltiazem for the rate control, and no
further episodes of atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred.

3.  Nutrition:  The patient was temporarily fed with tube
feeds and tolerated a normal diet two days prior to
discharge.

4.  Oncology, squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient did have
excision of her endobronchial lesion which was squamous cell
carcinoma.  On CT, it was noted that she had an extra
bronchial mass adjacent to the endobronchial lesion.  Also
noted was a lobulated mass in the region of the right hilum
which appeared to extend to the adjacent fissure.  There was
also reportedly an enlarged lower right paratracheal lymph
node and also enlarged subcarinal nodes.  Also noted was a
possible lower right cervical lymph node measuring
approximately 2 x 2.

She was referred to Dr. ................... at the Division
of Oncology at [**Hospital6 256**].  The
office has been [**Name (NI) 653**], and they will follow-up with the
patient's husband for a new patient appointment with Dr.
.................. once it becomes available.

A CT of the head with contrast was performed to look for CNS
metastases of which there was no evidence.

intervention pulmonology (IP) and oncology.  Oncology felt
systemic treatment would be a little benefit. Also, IP felt that
stent placement would be two high risk a procedure to undertake
especially if no other treatment would reduce her tumor burden.
Therefore the patient's grave prognosis was explained to her and
her husband.  They were overwhelmed but understood, and stated
the desire to home with family.  A DNR/DNI order was placed, a
palliative care consult was obtained, and home hospice was
arranged.  On [**7-27**] the patient was discharged from the SICU to

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 22867**] is a 64-year-old female with a history of stage IIIA
non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2116**] at which time she
underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol,
surgery and then subsequent chemo and radiation.  She was doing
well until [**2124-6-5**] when an irregular lesion was found in her
right lower lobe on CT scan.  Core needle biopsy revealed it to
be
bronchioalveolar type carcinoma.  On her scan at that time there
was also two other areas of ground-glass opacities in the left
upper lobe raising the possibility of multifocal disease. On
[**2124-6-14**], she underwent a reoperative
thoracotomy, pulmonary lysis of adhesions and right lower lobe
wedge resection.  Pathology revealed a 3.5 cm well
differentiated adenocarcinoma that was originally identified as
a pT2 N0 Mx lesion, but within the same wedge, a 1-cm satellite
nodule of adenocarcinoma peripheral to the dominant mass was
identified and therefore she was deemed T4.  She subsequently
received Gemzar
and Avastin for a total of eight cycles for presumptive adjuvant
therapy.  She reports that she did not complete all the Avastin
given some visual changes she was having given her previous
history of stroke.  After this time she underwent surveillance
CT scans and most recently had a PET scan in [**2126-7-7**] which
revealed a new nodular abnormality with increased activity in
the right lower lobe.  She is being admitted for a Right
completion pneumonectomy.

change.

[**2126-9-24**] IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Status post right pneumonectomy with multiple air-fluid
levels raising the concern for a fistula between the right
bronchial stump and the right

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 22868**] was admitted on [**2126-9-18**] for Completion Right
pneumonectomy with serratus flap. She was extubated in the
operating room and transferred to the SICU
for further management.   Her pain was well controlled with a
Dilaudid/Bupivicane epidural managed by the acute pain service.
The chest-tube remained clamped and the foley was to gravity.
She remained hemodynamically stable, oxygen saturations were
100% on 3 Liters via nasal cannula and her electrolytes were
repleted. She was started on IV lopressor for tachycardia.  On
POD #1 she was transfused with 1 unit PRBC for a Hct of 24. The
chest-tube was removed. Her diet was advanced as tolerated, she
transferred to the floor.  On POD #2 she was followed by serial
chest x-rays which remained stable.  On POD #3 she developed
atrial fibrillation with a RVR of 130-140's. The beta-blocker
was increased, amiodarone drip was started and her electrolytes
were repleted, and her cardiac enzymes were negative. Her TSH
was mildly elevated in the immediate postoperative state.  She
was transfused with 1 unit of PRBC for a Hct of 23 to a Hct of
25.  The epidural was removed and she was converted to PO pain
medications. On POD #4 she remained in rapid atrial
fibrillation.  Cardiology was consulted who recommended stopping
amiodarone, increasing beta-blockers and starting diltiazem.  On
POD #5 she remained in atrial fibrillation, DOE and still
requiring 02 at 4L via nasal cannula for a saturation of 96%. An
echocardiogram revealed mild LVH. mild regional LV systolic
dysfunction, lateral and inferior hypokinesis. No AS or AR.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR, Severe [4+] TR. moderate PA systolic
HTN and  a small pericardial effusion.  She was ruled out for
Pulmonary Embolism by CT.  Her coumadin was restarted. On POD #6
her heart rate was better controlled with PO/IV diltiazem, and
lopressor.  On POD #[**8-13**] her IV diltiazem was titrated down.  Her
atrial fibrillation remained 80-100's.  On POD #9 she was weaned
from the diltiazem drip.  Her blood pressure remained stable.
The foley was removed and she voided without difficulty. On POD
#10 her heart rate increased and she was started on digoxin with
better rate control. Her coumadin was held for an elevated INR.
On POD #12 cardiology recommended to continue the diltiazem 60
Q6h, lopressor 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], and digoxin 0.125 daily.  She was
seen by Physical Therapy.  On POD #13 she developed episodes of
bradycardia with pauses in the 30's.  Her digoxin level was 0.6.
 Cardiology recommended decreasing the diltiazem and
beta-blockers.  She was started on ACE for afterload reduction.
She was transfused to a HCT of 30.  On POD #14 her heart rate
increased her meds were adjusted to maintain a heart rate in the
100's. She was continued on her coumadin with goal INR of
2.0-3.0. On POD#15-18, her coumadin was adjusted daily to
maintain INR at goal - she received 1mg daily. Her atrial
fibrillation with RVR continued with HR at times spiking above

Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis, ?pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid Bronchoscopy
Attempted bronchial artery embolization
Stereotactic Brain Biopsy

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 66 yo male with h/o htn, glucose
intolerance, recent dx of NSCLC who presents as a transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] for rigid bronchoscopy and possible embolization
for hemoptysis.
.
Briefly, he began coughing up small amounts of bright red blood
roughly three month ago. He started noticing streaks of blood in
his sputum which progressed to about nickel-sized bits of blood.
He was then referred for a CAT scan of his chest which revealed
a large right upper lobe spiculated mass suspicious for
malignancy. He has a history of COPD; however, has not been
severely affected by this and it does not seem to impede on his
daily activites. He has a 100-pack-year history of smoking and
has quit 10 years ago, and lost 25 lbs recently.
.
He was then referred for PET scan which was positive.
Subsequent bronch on [**2175-12-15**] at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed path consistent
with NSCLC.  He tolerated the procedure well, and then on
[**2175-12-19**] he began to develop more hemoptysis.  He decided to
drive himself to the [**Hospital3 **] ED, where he presented in
respiratory distress and was promptly intubated for airway
protection.  He became hypotensive in the setting of intubation
and sedation, and was started on Neosynephrine.
.
He was awaiting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], and had imaging that showed
the mass and a RLL consolidation.  He spiked a fever on [**2175-12-21**],
and was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.  He had a left
IJ central line placed.  His neosynephrine was changed to
Levophed.  His levofloxacin was changed to pip/tazo.  His blood,
urine, and sputum were cultured with no growth at the time of
discharge.  There was a question of adrenal insufficiency, and
he was on decadron.  His [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was showed a good response,
so he was stopped today.
.
On arrival, he was sedated and intubated, without communicating
any complaints.
.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY:
CT Chest ([**12-23**]): FINDINGS: The right upper lobe mass has grown
from 2.8 x 4.2 cm to 4.3 x 5.7 cm, 2:14, with progressive
invasion of mediastinal fat, up to the trachea, esophagus, and
normal calibre, superior vena cava, and new occlusion of the
right upper lobe bronchus, 2:18, 22. The right upper lobe
pulmonary artery is more severely encased by the tumor and
significantly narrowed but not occluded. New right upper lobe
posterior segment consolidation and extensive ground glass
involving most of the anterior segment of right upper lobe might
represent post-obstruction pneumonia. Lingular atelectasis has
significantly progressed, although no endobronchial lesion is
demonstrated, 3:33.
New bilateral moderate nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusion
is accompanied by considerable bilateral relaxation atelectasis.
Heart size is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates normal
liver, spleen, adrenals, tail of the pancreas and upper portion
of the kidney. There are no bone lesions suspicious for
malignancy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant interval progression of the right upper lobe
tumor size, mediastinal, occlusion of the right upper lobe
bronchus obstruction and most likely obstructive pneumonia,
conceivably hemorrhage.
2. New moderate, bibasilar pleural effusion and severe
relaxation atelectasis.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, not significantly changed.
5. Coronary calcifications.
6. Emphysema.
.
CT Head ([**12-23**]): There is a roughly 2.2 x 2.0 cm area of
hypodensity (Hounsfield units 21) in the right medial
cerebellum. This area did not demonstrate FDG avidity on the
recent PET CT. On the current study, although it is difficult to
fully evaluate, there may be an 8-mm ring-enhancing nodule in
the central portion of this larger lesion. For example, please
series 6, image 7. No other areas concerning for enhancing
lesions are identified within the brain. There is no
hydrocephalus. There is no definite mass effect on the fourth
ventricle. The major vascular structures appear unremarkable.
Note is made of calcifications within the cavernous carotid
arteries bilaterally. No osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodensity in the medial right cerebellum, incompletely
evaluated. An MRI of the brain with gadolinium may be valuable
in further characterization.
.
Brain MRI ([**12-24**]): IMPRESSION:
1. 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar
hemisphere, with some perilesional edema, mild mass effect on
the adjacent portion of the fourth ventricle, representing
metastatic focus.
2. Increased signal in the internal auditory canals especially
the left internal auditory canal on the post-contrast sequence
(series 9, image 8) may partly be related to enhancement. Hence,
leptomeningeal enhancement cannot be excluded based on this
appearance. To correlate with LP if necessary and attention to
be paid to this on future followup scans.
3. Significant amount of fluid versus mucosal thickening
involving bilateral mastoid air cells.
.
Bronchial Artery Embolization ([**12-25**]): IMPRESSION: Thoracic
aortogram demonstrates a diffusely enlarged and tortuous aorta.
A selective right bronchial-intercostal arteriogram showed no
abnormal blush or extravasation. Several attempts were made to
advance a microcatheter into this artery, but were unsuccessful

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] was a 66-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of NSCLC
with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, who presented with hemoptysis
and respiratory failure, underwent bronchoscopy with
cauterization, was successfully extubated, and underwent
unsuccessful attempt at bronchial artery embolization [**2175-12-25**]
due to tortuous aorta.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient was previously intubated for
airwary protection at OSH in setting of hemoptysis assumed to be
from his known large lung mass.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
underwent rigid bronchoscopy.  [**Last Name (un) **] showed significant amounts
of clot in R bronchial tree, and he underwent removal of some
clots and cauterization of bleeding areas. He was extubated
[**12-23**].  He was found to have a RUL PNA on CT scan [**12-23**], which
was thought to be post-obstructive, and he was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn).  He continued to have
quarter size amount of hemoptysis with subjective SOB requiring
a NRB.  On [**12-25**], IR tried bronchial artery embolization which
was unsuccessful secondary to his tortuous aorta. He received
Spiriva and Albuteral nebs prn. He was transferred out of the
ICU ot OMED where he continued to improve clinically, requiring
no supplemental oxygen by discharge.
.
# NSCLC/Hemoptysis: CT Chest showed that the right upper lobe
mass has grown from 2.8 x 4.2 cm on [**2175-11-1**] to 4.3 x 5.7. The
right upper lobe pulmonary artery was
more severely encased by the tumor and significantly narrowed
but not occluded.  Rigid [**Last Name (un) 1066**] showed significant amounts of
clot in R bronchial tree, and he underwent removal of some clots
and cauterization of bleeding areas.  IR attempted bronchial
artery embolization which was unsuccessful secondary to his
tortuous aorta. Radiation oncology was consulted and recommended
the patient be transferred from MICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for XRT after brain
biopsy. The patient underwent palliative XRT initially but after
his brain biopsy came back negative for malignancy by
preliminary report, he had definitive XRT. He received one cycle
of carboplatin/paclitaxil during this admission.
.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia: CT chest showed RUL PNA, which was
likely post-obstructive.  WBC peaked at 17.0, and he was febrile
at OSH.  BAL Culture had sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.
Blood culture with NGTD. He was given a 12-day course of
vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for broad coverage of
post-obstructive vs. hospital aquired pneumonia.
.
# Mental status changes, likely brain metastasis: Patient was
awake, alert, oriented, but initially complained of visual
hallucinations and had R eye ptosis with increased lacrimation.
CT head on [**12-23**] showed 2.2 x 2.0 cm area of hypodensity in the
right medial cerebellum which did not demonstrate FDG avidity on
the recent PET CT.  A follow up Brain MRI showed 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7
cm enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere,
representing a metastatic focus.  Leptomeningeal enhancement of
L internal auditory canal could not be excluded.  Neurosurgery
was consulted, and the patient underwent a stereotactic brain
biopsy on [**12-27**] which was negative for malignancy by preliminary
report.
.
# Hypotension->Hypertension:  Patient was hypotensive at time of
transfer, requiring levophed, however his blood pressure
improved with cessation of sedation and extubation.  He was not
found to be adrenally insufficient at the outside hospital.  His
CVP transduced upon admission was 4.  It was felt less likely
that the patient had a sepsis from his pneumonia, and blood Cx
showed NGTD.  Since extubation, patient has become hypertensive
with SBP 190-200.  He was started on captopril for tighter blood
pressure control, but by discharge he was restarted on
lisinopril. Amlodipine was held, however, and was to be added
back by PCP when appropriate

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
successful Right thoracotomy, right upper lobectomy with
mediastinal lymph node dissection and en bloc resection of
azygos vein.  The patient was then brought to the intensive care
unit, intubated, but hemodynamically stable.  He had 2 right
chest tubes, foley and Epidural for pain managed by the acute
pain service.  On POD #1 he was extubated and transferred to the
floor.  He was seen by physical therapy who recommended home
when ready.  On POD #2 he had a brief episode of atrial
fibrillation and responded well to beta-blockers. On chest-tube
was removed and follow-up CXR showed small right apical
pneumothorax.  On POD #3 his HCT was found to be 23 and
transfused with 2 units of PRBC repeat HCT 32. On POD #4 the
remainder chest tube was removed and his CXR confirmed a stable
right apical airspace.  The epidural was converted to PO pain
medication with good control.  His foley was removed and he
voided without difficulty.  He continued to ambulate in at the

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2181-7-15**]
The chest tube has been removed. Since the chest tube removal,
there appears to have been increased shift of mediastinal
structures to the left. No pneumothorax is identified. There is
increased volume loss on the left with increased opacification
of left lung. Right lung is relatively clear with minimal
atelectasis in the right lung base.
IMPRESSION:
Status post left chest tube removal with mediastinal shift to
the left,
increased opacification of left lung.

[**2181-7-16**] Portable CXR: persistent opacification of the left
hemithorax

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-11**]: The patient underwent the above procedure.  He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the TSICU for intense
monitoring following the procedure.  He had an epidural in place
for pain relief, diet was advanced slowly, foley catheter in
place, two chest tubes in place to suction.

[**7-12**]: The patient was transferred to the floor for continued
monitoring.  He developed supraventricular tachycardia followed
by atrial fibrillation.  He remained hemodynamically stable and
asymptomatic.  He was given Lopressor 5mg IV for a total of five
doses, he did not convert.  He was given a bolus of Amiodarone
150mg and drip and converted to sinus rhythm. The patient became
hypotensive and the amiodarone drip was stopped.  He remained in
sinus rhythm.  The chest tubes were placed to water-seal with no
air leak.  His pain was relieved with an epidural.

[**7-13**]: He had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation and the
amiodarone drip was restarted and he converted sinus rhythm. He
was diuresed.  He was seen by physical therapy whom declared him
safe for home.

[**7-14**]: Remains in sinus rhythm, on PO amiodarone and atenolol.
The apical chest-tube was removed.

[**7-15**]: The remaining chest-tube was removed.  His HCT was found
to 24 for which he was transfused 2 unit PRBC to a HCT of 30.

[**7-16**]: The epidural was removed and his pain was well controlled
with PO pain medication.  The foley was removed and he voided
without difficulty.  He underwent flexible bronchoscopy which
showed an adherent fibrin clot. The chest x-ray revealed a
collapsed left lower lobe.

[**7-17**]: The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy for removal of
fibrin clot. He tolerated the procedure well.  The follow-up CXR
revealed moderates increased aeration of the left lung.  He was
discharged to home and will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 1 week.

treatment of SC lung CA via photodynamic therapy, now with GIB.

.
Briefly, his OSH course began in late [**Month (only) 958**] when he was admitted
for COPD exacerbation. He was dc'd on [**5-13**] but returned on [**5-17**]
with increased SOB, secretions, hypoxia and rapid afib. During
his hospital course he was found to have RLL PNA and tx with
levaquin, zosyn, tobramycin nebulizers and high dose steriods.
He had a bronch on [**5-20**] with b/l mucoid impacation and
endobronchial lesion. On [**5-28**] he had repeat bronch showing RUL
endobronchial lesion and biopsy demonstrating NSCLC. His course

shoued large sigmoid polyp that was not removed, diffuse
diverticulosis, multiple small polyps and no active bleed. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-6**] for futher management of RUL
carcinoma.
Here he underwent the first 2 portions of photodynamic therapy
([**6-8**] and [**6-10**]) and was awaiting debridement when he developed
BRBPR and tachycardia on the morning of [**6-11**]. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes, he
had a large amt of BRBPR in the morning. He began to get
anxious, respiratory rate increased and he became hypertensive
to 170/110 with HR in the 140s. Audible wheezes were noted on
exam, so he was given 20 mg IV lasix for presumed flash
pulmonary edema. He was give IV lopressor 5 mg IV for HR. His
hct and plts were checked and stable. He put out 500 cc to the
lasix, RR rate improved and sats were 95% on 4L prior to txfr.
HR improved to 83.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71M PMH CVID, COPD, bronchietasis, new dx of NSCLC
undergoing phototherapy and recent LGIB who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] for photodynamic therapy for his lung cancer and management
of rectal bleeding.
.
1 Non small cell lung cancer: He has known COPD and
bronchiectasis but was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] with a new RUL mass c/w
NSCLC for which he received photodynamic therapy. He requires 3L
NC O2 at baseline. His oxygenation need increased slightly
around the time of treatment but improved to baseline by
discharge. He went to OR [**6-13**], [**6-14**] for debridement. His
prednisone was changed from 40 mg to 20 mg [**6-7**] and from 20 mg
to 10 mg on [**6-11**] but increased again to 20 mg [**6-13**], then to 15mg
at time of discharge. This should be slowly tappered. He was
continued on his azythromycin and inhaled tobramycin
prophylaxis. He was also continued on fluticasone inhaled and
nasal spray, as well as xopenex nebulizers. He will need follow
up with interventional pulmonary after discharge and he will
need photodynamic precautions (no UV light exposure, speacial
glasses) for 6 weeks from [**2163-6-13**].
.
2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding: He was transferred with bright red
blood per rectum. He had continuing melena and bright red blood
here despite holding coumadin and aspirin, with intermittent
decrease in hematocrit requiring blood transfussions. He had a
recent colonoscopy at the outside hospital prior to transfer
which showed a polyp and diverticuli. It was noted to be a poor
prep so the colonoscopy was repeated here [**6-17**] and showed: bright
red blood, diverticulosis.
.
3 Pancytopenia: New thrombocytopenia diagnosed during his OSH
admission.  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] report he is HIT Ab negative.
 This improved during his course suggesting improving
consumption from bleeding possibly.  He also had leukopenia
during his course but this improved by time of discharge and was
thought possibly related to his CVID.
.
4 Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine but this
improved to creatinine of 0.8 by discharge.
.
5 Atrial fibrilation: He remained in NSR and rate controlled on
short-acting diltiazem 60mg qid. His home regimen is 240mg
long-acting in the morning, 180mg long-acting at night. His
coumadin and aspirin were held given his gastrointestinal
bleeding.
.
6 CVID: He had no active issues regarding his immune deficiency.
He normally receives IvIg every 2 weeks and was due for this on
[**6-15**]. He was dosed per his infusion center at [**Hospital **] hospital
in [**Location (un) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78393**]: 30 gm, tylenol 1000mg, benedryl 25mg
po. pre medication. He ws also due for vitamin b12 1000 mcg sq
(q month) so this was given in house.
.
7 Hyperglycemia: He was noted to have elevated blood sugar on
prednisone so was given a diabetic diet and covered with sliding
scale insulin for control of his sugars.

Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer- Lower extremity weakness/cauda equina
Perforated bowel

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2152-4-27**] Exploratory laparotomy, Right colectomy, ileostomy
placement
[**2152-5-9**] Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o male w/ probable metastatic lung ca, met to L5 spine, who
presents from OSH with leg weakness secondary to cauda equina
syndrome. He was admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2152-4-17**] with a
20 lb weight loss and long standing history of progressive low
back pain, followed by leg weakness. The low back pain has been
an issue for the last 2-3 years, but over the last 2 months has
become more severe and has radiated to his posterior thigh and
calves. In addition he reports numbness of his feet, which began
2-3 years ago. Within the last 2 weeks he has not been able to
walk and has been wheelchair bound. He reports that he cannot
stand due to pain rather than to weakness. He denies loss of
bowel or bladder function.

Neuro evaluation there on [**2152-4-17**] showed normal pin sensation of
LEs, although there was subjective numbness of the feet. No
focal weakness of the extremity muscles was noted to manual
testing and DTRs were noted to be 1+ and symmetric at knees, and
absent at ankles.

Work-up showed a destructive lesion in L5 with a soft tissue
component, likely representing metastatic disease. There was
also evidence of pathologic compression of the body of L5 and
severe foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 with cauda equina
compression.  He was also found to have a cavitary lesion in the
right upper lobe of the lung measuring almost 1cm, suspicious
for nonsmall cell lung cancer, likely squamous cell. Biopsy of
the L5 lesion was performed and results were pendning at time of
transfer. The patient was started on reglan and external beam
XRT. His pain improved after optimization of his pain regimen,
however he became constipated. He also had a foley placed for
?urinary retention. He was seen daily by neurosurgery and there
was a long debate on how to proceed. Clinically the patient was
not improving and still had significant leg weakness, and
therefore it was recommended by the neurosurgeons to transfer
him for consideration of cyberknife treatment.

Note dated [**2152-4-20**] comments that patient reported legs were
weaker than the day prior. Note dated [**2152-4-24**] reports patient can
lift lower extremities bilaterally but cannot wiggle toes with
slight foot drop on L.

On arrival today, patient reports pain in low back. Complains of
weakness and numbness of his lower extremities, which he reports
has become worse over the last 2 days. He reports constipation
and abdominal distention, however he does admit to having a
small BM yesterday. He also admits though that he does have
numbness in his buttocks and does not feel that he has full
control over his bowel movements. In regards to urinary
retention, this is less clear, because he currently has a foley
catheter. He reports this was placed after he was told his urine
output was not as good as it should be.
Denies upper extremity weakness or numbness. no cough,
hoarseness, chest pain, sob.

ROS: as per hpi. also denies cough, sob, sputum production or
hemoptysis. no headache, n/v, vision changes. low back pain, +
left hip pain, lower extremity weakness, and numbness in toes.

superimposed upon diffuse centrilobular emphysema. The most
likely cause for these findings includes ARDS or multifocal
pneumonia.
3. Small pneumoperitoneum.

[**2152-5-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in size of the patient's right upper lobe cavitary
lesion as noted. Decreased prominence of bilateral patchy
airspace opacities previously noted. Persistent airspace
opacities seen within the right lung with debris in the right
mainstem bronchus as noted. Soft tissue attenuation surrounding
the airways of the right lung as noted, likely reflecting the
patient's known lung carcinoma.
2. Significant distention of numerous loops of small bowel. The
diffuse nature of this distention suggests a functional ileus.
No area of transition is seen to suggest a mechanical
small-bowel obstruction.
3. Free fluid seen within the peritoneal cavity. If clinically
dictated, this may be accessed for aspiration via ultrasound
guidance to exclude infection.
4. Lytic L5 vertebral body lesion, previously seen on prior CT
to better detail.

[**2152-5-10**] CXR (most recent)
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess cardiopulmonary process
HISTORY: Ventilator-dependent failure with right cavitary
lesion.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the previous study, there is little
overall change. Again there is a large left upper lung cavity.
The atelectatic change at the left base has essentially cleared.
The left lung also is clear.

IMPRESSION Little change.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 y/o male w/ probable metastatic lung ca, met to L5
spine, who presents from OSH with leg weakness secondary to
cauda equina syndrome - will resulting colonic perforation.

Neuro:
He was admitted for workup and treatment of his symptomatic
spine lesion.  He was to be operated on but was found to have
perforated bowel.  He was never operated on and his symptoms of
cauda equina persisted.  After long discussion, it was decided
to not pursue spine stabilization.

CV:
Patient was in sinus tachycardia throughout the hospitalization.
 He was transfused one unit of blood for a HCT of 20 on the day
of discharge which brought his heart rate down to around 100.
He was rate controlled on IV metoprolol.

Pulm:
He was maintained on a ventilator throughout most of his
hospitalization.  He had a tracheostomy placed on [**5-9**] (three
days prior to d/c) and on the day of discharge was able to come
off the vent and have good 02 sats on trach mask.  He has a
large right lung abscess that was assessed by the thoracics
team.  It was determined by them that in the current setting IV
abx would be the best treatment.  Any intervention would not
likely improve survival

GI:
abdominal distention/constipation- KUB [**4-22**] w/o evidence of
obstruction.  suspect multifactorial from narcotics and cord
compression. On the operating table for spine surgery he was
found to have abdominal distension and a portable xray was done
which showed air under the diaphragm.  A STAT general surgery
consult was called and patient was taken emergently to the OR
for an exlap, R hemicolectomy, and placement of ileostomy.  His
fascia was closed but the skin was left open for wet to dry
dressing changes.  He was NPO and eventually had a PEG tube
placed without problem.  [**Name (NI) **] was tolerating tube feeds with good
ostomy function at discharge.

GU: He had has a foley in.  His urine output has been adequate

Endo: He was on a RISS

ID:  He was covered broadly for his lung abscess and post
operative prophylaxis.  He was discharged on Vanc, Cipro, Zosyn,
and Flagyl.  Fluconazole was started for yeast in Urine and
Sputum.  Should be d/c'ed on [**2152-5-15**].

FEN: has had hyponatremia - we have had him KVO and are trying
to fluid restrict him.

[**2151-3-4**] Echocardiogram: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque . The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation.

Chief Complaint:
IP evaluation with collapsed L lung due to lung cancer/mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, tumor
resection and argon plasma coagulation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 53 yo F with NSCLC diagnosed on [**2183-11-16**] transferred from
OSH for evaluation by IP for a mass obstructing her left main
stem bronchus.
.
At the time of her original diagnosis, the patient had presented
with hemoptysis and was found to have a left lung mass. Further
workup revealed poorly differentiated NSCLC. An MRI of the brain
and bone scan were reportedly negative but PET scan showed
increased uptake in the left lung as well as numerous chest
lymph node regions. There was also mild uptake in the left
adrenal (unclear if this is metastatic disease). Her staging is
currently believed to be IIIb v. IV. She recently had a second
opinion at [**Hospital3 328**] was was scheduled to begin chemotherapy
and radiation next week.
.
After originally being D/C'd from the OSH on [**2183-11-20**] after her
initial diagnosis (on home O2), she was readmitted from [**2183-11-30**]
- [**2183-12-5**] with a post-obstructive PNA. She was discharged home
on azithromycin/ceflin and prednisone. On the evening of
[**2183-12-12**] she had chest tightness and was admitted to the
hospital on [**2183-12-13**] with a collapsed left lung. She developed
hemoptysis yesterday while on the medicine floor at the OSH and
was transferred to their ICU. A bronchoscopy was performed this
afternoon prior to transfer and showed a large area of
endobronchial mass and obstruction. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation by IP.
.
She currently denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or any
difficulty breathing. She is oxygenating well on room air at
this time.

Past Medical History:
1. NSCLC dx [**10/2183**] - stage IIIB versus IV (unclear if uptake in
adrenals is metastatic disease). Supposed to start chemotherapy/
radiation in next 1-2 weeks. Port-a-cath placed today.
2. Hypothyroidism
4. Meningioma s/p removal in [**5-4**]
5. S/P Cholecystectomy
6. S/P Hysterectomy


Social History:
Divorced; works in food service at a school. Quit smoking 7
years ago; smoked 1.5ppd x 30 years. Has 3 children ages
33,32,30 (all live out of state).


Family History:

Pertinent Results:
OSH Imaging:
[**2183-12-13**] CTA Chest - No evidence of pulmonary embolism; Near
complete collapse of the left lung. This is likely due to left
hilar mass encasing the distal left main stem bronchus.
[**2183-12-15**] CXR - complete opacification at the left hemithoax is
again seen with shift in the mediastinum to the left consistent
with obstuctive pneumonitis with collapse demonstrated on recent
chest CT scan. There is compensatory hyperinflation of the right
lung which remains clear.
.

The patient was soon found to be stable for a floor transfer and
was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] on the evening for [**2183-12-16**] after
appropriate observation and evaluation by Interventional
Pulmonolgy.  On [**2183-12-17**] the patient was taken to the
bronchoscopy suite and stable for transfer to the PACU.  The
interventional pulmonologists performed a rigid bronchoscopy and
debridement of the left mainstem bronches under general
anesthesia.  On the 20th Interventional Pulmonology (referred to
as IP) evaluated the patient as requiring a flex bronchoscopy
for pulmonary toilet on that day with further debridement and
stent placement to follow on the 21th.  On the 21st
Flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, mechanical resection of tumor,
covered metal stent placement in the left lower lobe/left
mainstem bronchus and balloon dilation
were carried out, and the patient demonstrated no adverse
sequelae from the procedure. On the 21st Thoracic Surgery was
also consulted with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as the consulting attending
- a full note can be found in the OMR.    On the 22nd the
patient was evaluated by Interventional Pulmonology and found to
be stable for discharge with instructions to follow up with Dr.

Chief Complaint:
Lung cancer, LEFT upper lobe


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2153-3-28**]: Left thoracotomy with left upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node sampling (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 70 y.o. male with a lingular mass found
incidentally on a chest xray done prior to an ENT procedure. He
underwent EBUS and pathology from EBUS demonstrated poorly
differentiated carcinoma with negative nodes. Pathology showed
that the tumor displayed a small component of non-small-cell
lung
cancer as well as dominant component of neuroendocrine carcinoma
with some features suggestive of small cell carcinoma. Per
imaging, there is no distal disease. He underwent pulmonary
function testing which demosntated that he is a favorable
candidate for a lobectomy. He therefore presented for a LEFT
upper lobectomy.

Past Medical History:
- hydradenitis suppurativa, on Humira since [**2152**]
- thymoma s/p resection (median sternotomy [**2137**]) & XRT
- emphysema/COPD
- GERD
- Barrett's esophagus, EGD q 5 years without changes
- middle ear nerve damage with bilateral hearing aids
- thrush

Tobacco: quit [**2-/2152**], <1ppd x 15 yrs, 1ppd prior to that since
teens (55 years)
Alcohol: distant heavy use, abstinent since [**2148**].


Family History:
Family History: no cancers or immunodeficiencies


Pertinent Results:
Postop CT scan of chest ([**2153-3-30**]):
1. Status post left upper lobectomy with post-surgical
pneumothorax and trace fluid in the dependent surgical cavity.
2. Left posterior sixth rib surgical thoracotomy and
postoperative
subcutaneous emphysema along the posterior left chest wall.
3. Subcentimeter liver hypodensity within segment VIII, too
small to fully
characterize.
4. 1.7 cm right renal lesion measuring over 40 Hounsfield units,
which could represent a hyperdense cyst, but indeterminate and
could be further assessed by ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt underwent a LEFT upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
sampling through a thoracotomy incision. He tolerated the
procedure well and was extubated without difficulty.
Postoperative pain control was initially accomplished with an
epidural catheter but this was capped due to hypotension
requiring Neo in PACU. He was rapidly transitioned to oral pain
medication wtih IV narcotics for breakthrough pain. Chest tubes
placed during surgery were transitioned from suction to water
seal and then removed POD#2. Chest x-ray demonstrated no
significant pneumothroax but was indeterminate concerning an
effusion or consolidation. A chest CT was therefore obtained and
this demonstrated trace dependent fluid in the surgical cavity
and no evidence of pulmonary consolidation. By POD#3 the
patient's pain was well-controlled on oral pain medications, no
longer requiring supplemental oxygen, ambulating without
difficulty or need for assistance and tolerating a regular diet.
After evaluation by the thoracic surgery team, including
attending surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7343**], he was able to be discharged home
with his wife.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital for surgical removal of the
left upper lobe of your lung (lobectomy). You progressed very
well through your postoperative course and you are now ready for
discharge.

* Continue to use your incentive spirometer 10 times an hour
while awake.
* Check your incisions daily and report any increased redness or
drainage. Cover the area with a gauze pad if it is draining.
* Your chest tube dressing may be removed in 48 hours. If it
starts to drain, cover it with a clean dry dressing and change
it as needed to keep site clean and dry.
* You will continue to need pain medication once you are home
but you can wean it over a few weeks as the discomfort resolves.
Make sure that you have regular bowel movements while on
narcotic pain medications as they are constipating which can
cause more problems. Use a stool softener or gentle laxative to
stay regular.
* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.
* Take Tylenol 650 mg every 6 hours in between your narcotic. If
your doctor allows you may also take Ibuprofen to help relieve
the pain.

CXR [**9-18**] - Cardiac size is top normal. There is widening of the
mediastinum, greater on the right side in the right lower
paratracheal region and right superior perihilar region. This
could be due to lymphadenopathy and/or post-radiation changes if
the patient has had radiation. Mass-like opacity in the left
suprahilar region measures 49 x 56 mm. Ill-defined faint opacity
in the right upper lobe due to interstitial abnormality could be
secondary to radiation. Other smaller lung nodules are seen in
the lower lobes bilaterally. Left lower lobe retrocardiac
opacity likely represent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2168-5-31**]
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: No significant change is
seen compared to prior study. Left-sided subclavian central
venous line again seen with tip at the cavoatrial junction.
Surgical clips again seen at the mediastinum. There are
persistent postoperative changes consistent with left
pneumonectomy, with persistent left hydropneumothorax, similar
in appearance compared to prior study. Mild blunting of the
right costophrenic angle consistent with small pleural effusion
is also unchanged.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2168-5-31**]
ORAL PHASE: There is moderate reduction in bolus formation,
bolus control, and anterior-to-posterior tongue movement. There
was moderate impairment in the base of the tongue retraction.
Moderate oral residue was noted after the swallow. No premature
spillover was seen in the pharynx.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: The pharyngeal swallow was timely. There is
moderate reduction in laryngeal elevation and valve closure.
Epiglottic deflection was severely reduced. A moderate-to-severe
amount of residue remained in the vallecula, and a mild amount
of residue remained in the piriform sinuses after the swallow.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was penetration during the swallow
with thin liquids via straw sips. Aspiration occurred after the
swallow with thin- and thick-nectar liquids due to residue
falling from the laryngeal vestibule into the airway. Aspiration
was silent (without coughing). A cued cough was not effective in
clearing the aspirated material.
IMPRESSION:
1. Aspiration of thin liquids after the swallow with straw sips.
2. Cued cough was ineffective in clearing the aspirated
material.
3. No aspiration with nectar-thick liquid when
swallow-cough-swallow technique was performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is who was admitted on [**2168-5-23**] and underwent
successful  Left thoracotomy, left pneumonectomy with en bloc
chest wall resection (third rib); mediastinal lymph node
dissection, flexible bronchoscopy.  He was extubated in the
operating room and transferred to the SICU for close monitoring.
  His pain was managed with a Dilaudid Epidural managed by the
acute pain service.  He had a pen-rose drain , foley and NG tube
in place.  On POD #1 he was seen by ENT for his vagal resection
and found to have a left vocal fold paresis. He was seen by
Speech and Swallow and found to have moderate to severe
oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of small amounts of all
consistencies.  On POD #2 underwent Left true vocal fold Gelfoam
therapeutic injection.  On POD #3 he was transfused with 1 unit
PRBC to a Hct of 30, a Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed and tube
feeds were started per Nutrition recommendations. On POD #5 he
developed atrial fibrillation with a RVR and was started on IV
amiodarone converted to sinus rhythm within 24 hours.  On POD #6
he continued to remain hemodynamically stable and transferred to
the floor.  His epidural was converted to Dilaudid PCA with good
pain control. The foley was removed and he voided without
difficulty.  On POD #8 a repeat video-swallow was performed and
he aspirated with thin liquids. Speech recommended ground with
nectar thick and supervision feeds which was started and he
tolerated.  Follow-up Video-swallow in [**8-18**] days. He was seen by
physical therapy.  He was seen by ENT who recommended follow-up
in weeks.  On POD #10 he was restarted on his home medication
and PO pain meds.  He continued to make steady progress his
oxygen saturation remained 93% on room air while ambulating and
was discharged to rehab. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77594**] as an outpatient.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy, Y stent Placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 yo F with history of HIV (Last CD4 186 on
[**11-30**]) and recently diagnosed metastatic small cell lung cancer,
presenting with worsening shortness of breath x 5 days. On
admission to the hospital, the patient reported she has had
worsening shortness of breath over the prior 5 days to the point
where she is unable to climb stairs and lie flat. She had been
using her inhalers at home with some relief of symptoms. + cough
with pink tinged sputum 2 days ago. Denied fevers or chills. She
was started on prednisone for these symptoms by her primary
doctor in the week prior to admission. She reports + pleuritic
pain in right chest when coughing. Denied other chest pain,
abdominal pain, urinary complaints, bowel changes, or lower
extremity pain/swelling.

In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.3, HR 109, BP 161/115, RR
40, O2 Sat 97% with neb. O2 sat's decreased to 88% NS. This
improved with continued neb treatments to the mid 90's on 4L.
Original symptoms improved with 2 combivnet nebs. She received
ceftriaxone 1g x 1 and azithromycin 500mg PO x 1 because of
concern for PNA. A CTA was performed and prelim read was no PE.
However, the study showed new mediastinal lymphadenopathy
causing lingular and left upper lobe collapse as well as a
destructive lesion centered in the right third rib with invasion
into the adjacent anterior chest wall and pulmonary parenchyma.


She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately triggered
twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU.
There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the
right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also
revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with
bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete
occlusion of the airway on exhalation. She was then transferred
to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for rigid bronchoscopy, which was performed
on [**2170-1-25**]. Endobronchial tumor was debrided with APC and a
Y-stent was deployed successfully. During her ICU course she was
started on levo/flagyl for empiric treatment of post-obstructive
PNA, but given her lack of fevers/WBC/cough, these were d/c'ed
on antibiotic day #4. She was maintained on steroids and a taper
was initiated.

She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**2170-1-27**] for
possible palliative chemo/XRT. At that point her SOB and
associated chest pain had entirely resolved, and that she is in
no pain. She had no F/C and denies any complaints.

At 2:30 AM on [**2170-1-29**], she again was in respiratory distress,
with deep ronchi and desatting down into the low 80s when not
given additional oxygen. She improved with suction; however, a
portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right
upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side,
now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured
hemidiaphragm. When asked about intubation, the patient was not
clear on her goals and simply stated that she hoped we didn't
have to do that. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation
and closer monitoring and nursing care. She was on precautions
for a positive C. diff during this admission, for which she had
been prescribed Flagyl, as below.

cycle of chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide from
[**2169-12-11**] until [**2169-12-13**].

Social History:
Pt is currently on disability. She used to be a drug and alcohol
counselor. Smoked 2.5ppd x 36 yrs; quit 5 months ago when
diagnosed. No EtOH. History of heroin IV use, cocaine use. Quit
20 years ago. 4 children. She lives with her mother and one of
her daughters.

Family History:
4 children, one son with HIV. Mother: s/p pacer, lymphoma

Physical Exam:
Vitals - HR 89 BP 127/75 RR 26 O2 89% on cool neb oxygen (79-80
on 2.5L when triggered by RN on onc floor)
General - SOB, labored breathing, using accessory muscles of
respiration, not able to use voice, mouthing sentences
Neck - + anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
CV - distant heart sounds, no appreciable murmur
Lungs - extremely loud low-pitched ronchi, unclear air movement
through most of lung fields (i.e., most sounds are projected
upper airway sounds), some air movement at lower right)
Abdomen - soft, NT/ND, BS+

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2170-1-23**] CXR - Opacity involving the entire left lobe of the lung
is concerning for left lobe destruction.
[**2170-1-23**] CTA - 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Marked increased size
of confluent mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular
collapse as well as left upper lobe collapse. Marked increased
size of destructive lesion within the lateral right third rib.
[**2170-1-29**] CXR - verbal report only: significant
atelectasis/collapse of RUL; worsening of opacity and more
obscure hemidiaphragm on left. Only clear region is RLL.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo F with HIV, small cell lung cancer, and HTN admitted with
SOB. Found to have left upper/lingular lung collaspe.

# SOB - She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately
triggered twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to
the ICU. There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed
that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor,
and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with

She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**2170-1-27**] for
possible palliative chemo/XRT. At that point her SOB and
associated chest pain had entirely resolved, and that she was in
no pain. She had no F/C and denies any complaints.

On [**2170-1-29**], she again was in respiratory distress, with deep
ronchi and desatting down into the low 80s when not given
additional oxygen. She improved with suction; however, a
portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right
upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side,
now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured
hemidiaphragm. She was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where a
bronchoscopy was performed and a large mucous plug was removed.
Her respiratory status improved, and she was again called out to
the floor.

On the floor she required interventional pulmonary to perform
one additional bronch on [**2-9**], where additional tumor and mucus
were removed. She received chest PT qid, aggressive mucolytics,
and nebs RTC. She did not plug again but remained with a small
of requirement and a junky exam. Her steroids were tapered as
she briefly experienced some hallucinations thought to be a side
effect.  Respiratory status at this point stabilized, but given
her poor prognosis, she was discharged home with hospice
therapy.

# Small Cell Lung Cancer - The patients small cell lung cancer
has returned after an initial response to chemotherpy in
[**Month (only) **].  She had a Y stent placed (see above) for tumor
obstruction of her left and right bronchus.  She was started on
chemotherapy on [**2-2**] when she received palliative irinotecan.
The palliative care team met with the patient multiple times and
the pt wished to remain full code. She received 5 sessions of
palliative XRT to the chest for tumor shrinkage.  Given poor
prognosis, patient preferred to go home with hospice, though she
remained Full Code throughout her hospital stay.

# C Diff - Treated with Flagyl x 14 day course with result of
diarrhea improvement.

# HIV infection. CD4 171, VL 32K ([**12-31**]). Continued on
outpatient regimen of enfuvirtide, fosamprenavir, didanosine,
stavudine, and atovaquone prophylaxis.

# Depression: Continue on outpatient venlafaxine and
amitriptyline.

# Hypertension: had been on atenolol at home.  She was switched
to metoprolol at the time of admission for better blood pressure
control.  She then became normotensive without medical therapy
and remained so at the time of discharge.  Was discharged
without antihypertensive therapy to home hospice.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on pravastatin.

Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable and afebrile


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath. You
needed our lung doctors to [**Name5 (PTitle) **] a stent in your trachea to keep
it open, as your cancer had invaded into the lung and caused
blockage of a large portion of your airway. Mucus continued to
clog your airway and you required multiple bronchoscopies with
removal of tumor and mucus. You also had 1 dose of palliative
chemotherapy, and 5 sessions of palliative radition, to try to
alleviate your symptoms.

While here you also developed an infection of your stool which
causes diarrhea. You were treated with antibiotics x 14 days and
your diarrhea improved.
.
You will be going home with hospice services. Please take all
you medications as prescribed. Please keep all followup
appointments. If you experience any symptoms which concern you,
please call the on [**Name8 (MD) 138**] RN, your doctor, or go to the ED.

Pt required brief ICU admission for poor oxygenation postop,
likely contributed by underlying CA, postop fluid mobilization
after removal of pleural effusion, obesity and anesthesia. His
O2 requirement improved by end of POD#1 and came out of ICU
then. Chest tube was placed on water seal POD#1 and removed

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 53-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for HIV, Hep C, metastatic squamous cell lung ca
with mets to the brain who was transferred from an outside
hospital with a seizure. The patient only recalls that his blood
sugars were elevated on the night before admission, that he got
up to go to the bathroom around 1 am, and remembers waking up
around 8 am in the bathtub covered with stool. He denies
confusion, but reports some left sided numbness that has
persisted but improved slightly. Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**]
hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area
2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.

Past Medical History:
Past onc history (per Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] initial outpatient note
[**2110-6-9**]):  Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] developed hemoptysis in [**2110-3-1**]. A
chest X-ray and chest CT showed a tumor in his R lung. He
underwent a bronchoscopy at an OSH, which was complicated by
hemorrhage. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2110-5-7**] to have the broncoscopic biopsy with
bronchial stent placement. Pathology showed poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with ulceration, necrosis
and lymphovascular invasion. Subsequent PET/CT showed the lung
tumor together with brain metastases. He was taken to [**Hospital1 9191**], where he had a gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, showing
brain metastasis.  He was started on dexamethasone for this.

The patient was referred by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]
(neuro-onc at [**Hospital1 18**]) for management of his brain mets. He
presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] office on [**2110-6-9**]. He had a nonproductive
cough but denied fever, chills, nightsweat,headache, nausea,
vomiting, seizure, imbalance, urinary  incontinence, or fall. He
was sent to the ED for further management and admitted to the
Interventional Pulmonary service. A bronch on [**6-10**] showed that
the stent had migrated proximally. The stent was replaced, and
the patient is being transferred to the Oncology service for
further management of his oncologic issues.

Imaging:

[**2110-6-21**]. PA/LATERAL CXR: A large central right upper lobe
mass is again demonstrated with associated right hilar and
paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Linear opacities projecting distal
to the mass may represent a component of minor post-obstructive
atelectasis or localized lymphangitic spread of tumor. Heart
size is normal. No pleural effusions or acute skeletal
abnormalities are identified.
IMPRESSION: Large central right upper lobe neoplastic mass with
associated
right paratracheal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. These
findings have
previously been evaluated by CT of the chest, and correlation
with that study recommended for more complete assessment.

[**2110-6-21**]. Non-contrast head CT.
Images are degraded by motion artefact. There is a 2.5 x 2.6 cm
right parasagittal frontal lobe mass with central areas of low
attenuation and extensive adjacent vasogenic edema unchanged
since recent MR study. There is no significant mass effect or
shift of normally midline structures. There are no other masses
or lesions. There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation is well preserved. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right frontal parasagittal mass with
surrounding
vasogenic edema, without significant mass effect or shift of
midline
structures. No hemorrhage.

[**2110-6-24**]. Triplanar post-Gadolinium spin echo T1-weighted
images and axial post-Gadolinium MP-RAGE of the head were
obtained. Again seen is an enhancing mass involving the right
frontal lobe with central area of apparent cavitation. The mass
measures approximately 2.7 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in its traverse, AP,
and craniocaudal dimensions. This appears to have minimally
increased in size since the prior study from [**2110-6-11**]. Again seen
is a large area of surrounding edema with sulcal effacement.
There is also depression of the right lateral ventricle and
minimal right to left shift of the normally midline structures.
No new enhancing lesions are identified. Overlying right frontal
burr hole is again seen. IMPRESSION: Large right frontal mass
with surrounding edema again visualized. The mass may have
minimally increased in size compared to [**2110-6-11**].

[**2110-7-3**] MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images of the head
were obtained without IV contrast.
The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy. There is
some
adjacent soft tissue swelling. There is no new intracranial
hemorrhage. There is again marked vasogenic edema. There appears
to be minimally increased subfalcine herniation with 14 mm
midline shift compared to 13 on prior, although this may be due
to technique and slice selection. There is
persistent edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle as
well as sulcal effacement, which overall is otherwise similar.
There is trace residual pneumocephalus. The subcutaneous
emphysema is similar. The mastoid processes are not well
pneumatized but are unchanged. The mucosal thickening in the
left mastoid is similar. IMPRESSION: Persistent right frontal
vasogenic edema with subfalcine herniation and minimally
increased midline shift, which may be due to technique. No new
intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2110-7-7**]  TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild aortic leaflet thickening without discrete
vegetation or valvular regurgitation. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 2816**] is a 53-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for HIV, Hep C, metastatic squamous cell lung ca
with mets to the brain who was transferred from an outside
hospital with a seizure. The patient only recalls that his blood
sugars were elevated on the night before admission, that he got
up to go to the bathroom around 1 am, and remembers waking up
around 8 am in the bathtub covered with stool. He denies
confusion, but reports some left sided numbness that has
persisted but improved slightly. Head CT at the [**Hospital 78319**]
hospital showed a large mass in the right frontoparietal area
2.5 cm in diameter with vasogenic edema.

1. Loss Of Consciousness:
The patient was admitted with loss of consciousness and left
sided numbness.  It is unclear whether the event was syncopal or
seizure related, though the latter is thought to be more likely
given his brain metastases.  Because of this, he was continued
on dexamethasone.  He was started on anti-epileptic medications
(initially dilantin, which was discontinued and keppra started
in its place per neurologic consultation).

2. Brain Metastases:
The patient has a known brain metastasis.  He was evaluated by
the neurosurgical service on this admission, and underwent a
steriotactic brain biopsy of a right frontal parasagittal mass
on [**6-23**], which showed a  poorly differentiated metastatic
carcinoma on pathologic evaluation. He then underwent craniotomy
and resection of the same mass on [**6-25**].  His post-operative
course was complicated by development of stroke symptoms: Left
facial droop and hemiplegia on [**6-29**].  CT revealed worsening
right frontal vasogenic edema with new foci of parenchymal and
possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and 13-mm leftward subfalcine
herniation.  He was started on mannitol and increased doses of
dexamethasone.  He underwent repeat head CT on [**2110-7-2**]
demonstrating no new bleeds and mild improvement in edema.  On
discharge, the patient had evidence of increasing strength on
his left side (ability to lift left leg against gravity and mild
resistance; and ability to move L hand mildly against gravity;
unable to lift forearm or shoulder).  He will complete a taper
of the dexamethasone following discharge, and should be
maintained on a dosage of 2mg twice daily following the taper.
He is also to see the radiation oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4580**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66047**].
Of note, the patient complains of intermittent headache, which
is relieved with dilaudid.

3. Non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to brain, adrenal
glands:
The patient has stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with
metastases to the brain and adrenals.  He has undergone stenting
and of the right mainstem bronchus, which is invaded/enveloped
by his R lung mass.  He will pursue additional oncologic
treatment near his home in [**Location (un) 5503**].  He is scheduled to see
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4580**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66047**] (radiation oncologist) on Thursday [**7-17**]
regarding radiation therapy.

4. Hyponatremia:
He developed hyponatremia following his brain resection.  The
hyponatremia was thought to be due to cerebral salt wasting as
well as SIADH from his lung cancer.  He was treated with a
hypertonic saline, fluid restriction, and lasix.  On discharge,
his sodium had normalized to 135 on continued fluid restriction,
salt tabs, and lasix.  He was encouraged to continue these
measures at home and to have his sodium checked by his PCP.

5. Fever:
The patient experienced fevers post-operatively.  His infectious
workup was notable for coagulase negative staph in two out of
two blood cultures on [**2110-7-3**].  Follow-up cultures were negative.
 TTE was w/o evidence of endocarditis.  His positive blood
cultures were attributed to contamination from his skin.  He
defervesced without intervention.

6. Steroid-induced diabetes:
The patient was kept on glyburide and SSI.  He is being
discharged on glyburide alone.

7. HIV/AIDS:
The patient is on HAART (CD4 150, HIV-1 < 50 copies/ml
[**2110-6-14**]). He was continued on HAART and bactrim prophylaxis
for PCP.

8. COPD:
asymptomatic during hospital stay.  Continued on inhalers.

9. CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI
-- this was discussed during conversations between the patient
and the palliative medicine service.  See below for exerpt
regarding the patients wishes and psychosocial concerns from a
note by palliative medicine physician, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]:

""a) His priority right now is to spend as much time as possible
with his family, especially with his partner of more than a
decade [**Name (NI) **].  He is hoping he can return home after this
hospitalization.  We discussed that he is to have another
re-evaluation with PT today or tomorrow; he is focused on doing
PT at home and prefers not to go to rehab.  He states that his
partner [**Name (NI) **] ([**Name2 (NI) **]) is experienced in caring for him and is
in fact employed to care for him (I did not catch the name of
agency -- [**Doctor Last Name 6382**]... something).

b) He is interested in pursuing tx options that his physicians
feel can help reduce tumor burden and palliate his disease, such
as XRT.  He is open to talking about transitioning to hospice
care in the future and in fact says [**Doctor First Name **] has been in contact with
[**Name (NI) 6136**] [**Name (NI) 269**] (his current agency) because they also do hospice
care.  He would like her to get as much support as possible in
the home; we discussed some of the various services they offer
including RN visits, personal care assistants, SW.

c) He mentioned to me that he has told his prior doctors here
that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] is not interested in being intubated again or being on
mechanical ventilation.  He initially said that ""CPR would be
OK, but no breathing tubes.""  However, as we discussed further
what his priorities are, it became clear that he wants any
remaining time to be spent alert, comfortable, and interactive
with his loved ones, not intubated or unconscious in the ICU.
Given this goal, he was able to articulate that if he were
gravely ill, he would want to be ""let go naturally.""  He wishes
to be DNR/DNI and I have conveyed this to his medical team.

We did not specifically discuss intubation for planned
procedures, but having a DNR/DNI code status does not prevent
him from undergoing future intubation for planned procedures
that could possibly benefit him clinically (such as
bronchoscopy).

d) He seems to be doing a good amount of reflecting on his life;
he shared about overcoming his very abusive childhood (mother
actively abused him and at one point he was hospitalized because
she gave him a soda can spiked with house cleaner; mother was
abused by father and ""she took it out on me because we had the
same name""); he states that he was a ""really bad person in his
young days"", did a lot of awful things.  He initially says that
maybe his cancer is punishment for his prior life, but then
recants and says he doesn't really believe he is being punished
-- ""life is just being unfair"";

He shared that he's happy he has done well with his dx of
HIV/AIDS, which he acquired from IVDU; shared with pride that he
has done a lot of HIV teaching in high school, is glad he has
done something constructive with the hard events in his life. We
came back to this point several times as he was reflecting on
life.""

Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 yo F with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer on
chemotherapy less than 24 hours, transferred to the ICU with
progressive hypoxia.
.
ICU evaluation was requested for hypoxia. The patient arrived
last night saturating well on 6L NC. This morning she was noted
on routine vitals to be saturating at 83% on 6L. She responded
to 91-95% on a non-rebreather. The patient denies any new
symptoms. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath. She does
note a non-productive cough for several hours. The patient had a
CXR which did not reveal a clear etiology of her hypoxia. ABG
was 7.37/51/64. She received 10mg IV furosemide given that she
likely had a positive fluid balance not well recorded since
admission. Due to persistent hypoxia she is transferred to the
ICU.
.
The patient was originally transferred from [**Hospital6 17390**] ICU with a new diagnosis small cell lung cancer. She
presented initially with complaints of abdominal pain, dysphagia
and generally not feeling well. She underwent an outpatient
work-up including normal nuclear stress test and CT abd/pelvis
with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. On [**2164-3-8**] she was admitted to
a hospital in [**Location (un) 78617**], FL for laparoscopic biopsy of a
mesenteric node, cecal mass and omentum. Biopsy was reactive and
benign. She returned to her PCP with complaints of persistent
weight loss and weakness. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 16549**] and on [**2164-4-30**] underwent an excisional biopsy
of a right axillary lymph node which confirmed high grade small
cell lung cancer. She was found on staging to have liver mets
and peribronchial lymphadenopathy. CTA at [**Hospital6 **]
revealed right lower lobe bronchus compression with right lower
lobe collapse, diffuse lymphadenopathy, small bilateral pleural
effusions and by verbal report to have invasion of the SVC with
associated SVC thrombus.
.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 2910**]
last night for emergent chemotherapy. She received cis-platinum
and etoposide with steroids.
.
ROS: Patient denies any complaints and cannot clearly recall the
symptoms that brought her in to the hospital. She denies fevers,
chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea, rashes, arthralgias or any
other concerning symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Lung Cancer: Ms. [**Known lastname 9241**] [**Known lastname **] was transferred from the NEBH
ICU for urgent chemotherapy. She began cisplatinum and etoposide
on the evening of admission. The following morning, she was
increasingly hypoxic to 83% on NC 6L. She was transfered to the
ICU. Her respiratory compromise was felt most likely due to
airway and vasculature compression/obstruction from tumor burden
as seen on recent CTA at the OSH. PE was felt possible though
not likely given recent CTA that was negative. The patient also
probably had a component of volume overload as seen on CXR and
consistent with a recent history of volume rescucitation. Of
note she likely has a contribution of compression from pleural
effusions though this was felt not likely to be the primary
force causing hypoxia. The patient was started on chemotherapy
with the goal of reducing tumor burden. She received 3 days of
cisplatinum and etoposide. Radiation oncology was consulted for
consideration of palliative XRT. Unfortunately the patient was
not able to lie flat in bed and therefore could not receive
radiation. If her respiratory status improves and she is able to
lie flat, then she could be an XRT candidate in the future. In
addition, the patient was diuresed as much as possible though
she required fluid boluses with chemotherapy administration and
therefore was only negative 1.6L during her stay in the ICU. She
also continued to receive nebulizer treatments. Her oxygenation
did improve somewhat and the patient left the ICU on 15L 40%
high flow mask. The patient and her family clearly wished for
the patient to be DNR/DNI with palliative therapy as possible.
On the floor, she was further diuresed. Her oxygen was weaned
down and her respiratory status improved.  She was reimaged on
[**2164-5-18**] and in comparison to previous CT scan showed 40-50%
reduction in tumor burden post-chemotherapy. A decision was made
to initiate a second cycle of chemotherapy with 3 days of
etoposide and cisplatinin which she tolerated without
difficulty. A repeat CT scan on day #14 after this chemotherapy
showed regression of previously extensive hilar adenopathy. Her
oxygenation status continued to improve and at time of discharge
she was satting 95-97% on room air.  She is scheduled to unergo
the third cycle of chemotherapy on Monday, [**6-18**].
.
# Hyponatremia: She also was found to have hyponatremia to 125
without mental status changes. Urine lytes revealed SIADH,
likely [**12-24**] paraneoplastic effect of small cell lung ca. TSH and
cortisol were normal. She was placed on fluid restriction.
Hyponatremia eventually resolved and was normal at time of
discharge.
.
# Neutropenia:  patient became neutropenic likely secondary to
chemotherapy dosing on admission. She was given Filgrastim for
two days after the first cycle of chemotherapy with improvement
in her white cell counts. Her white count was monitored closely
after second cycle of chemotherapy and became neutropenic with
lowest measured ANC of 144 at time of discharge. She remained
afebrile however. She will need to have a recheck of her white
count on Friday, [**6-15**] prior to starting her third cycle of
chemotherapy on Monday, [**6-18**] to ensure that her counts have
recovered.

# UTI: A screening urinalysis with culture showed enterococcus
in the urine on [**5-26**] and vancomycin was given empirically.
Final culture results showed sensitvity to macrobid, ampicillin
and vancomycin and patient was started on IV ampicillin. Patient
was switched to oral therapy with macrobid and will continue on
this for a total of four doses to complete a 10-day course of
antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection.

# Diarrhea: Developed diarrhea several days after cycle 2 of
chemotherapy with multiple watery bowel movements daily (up to
10 bm's per day). Infection with Clostridium difficile was
suspected, and antibiotics were started. Diarrhea resolved
one-day after initiation of antibiotics, however C. difficile
toxin assay was negative x3 and antibiotics were discontinued.
It is thought that diarrhea was likely chemotherapy induced.

Addendum:
To clarify, on [**5-5**] patient was found to have RML and RLL
complete collapse with a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
She was started on ceftriaxone and flagyl for presumed
post-obstructive pneumonia. Clinical impression was that she did
in fact have post-obstructive pneumonia. Later in her hospital
course, she was having difficulty with thin liquids and a speech
and swallow evaluation raised concerns for possible aspiration.
A Chest X-ray on [**5-22**] was performed but was without infiltrates.
The clinical impression at that time was that she did not have
an aspiration pneumonia and as such, she was not treated.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of small cell
lung cancer s/p completion of topotecan chemorx ([**2200-6-27**]) who was
initially admitted for failure to thrive, anemia, and
dehydration; now transferred to MICU for new onset of acute
right-upper quadrant abdominal pain, tachycardia, and relative
hypotension, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis.
He was initially admitted 3 days after initiating topotecan
therapy for small cell cancer recurrence due to diarrhea,
fatigue, and anemia.  Patient had been on ciprofloxacin for
neutropenic fever prophylaxis.  His diarrhea was thought
secondary to chemotherapy, and was treated with symptomatically.
 There was no history of fever, and patient denied chills or
feeling febrile.  He noticed acute onset of abdominal pain last
night while in bed, and denied nausea/vomitting.  Patient
acknowleged passing flatus and having loose bowel movements.  On
the morning of transfer, patient remained persistently
tachycardic and blood pressure was much lower than baseline at
110mmHg systolic (normally 150s-160s systolic).  He received a
total of 3 litres of saline in boluses.  Although he denied
dyspnea or chest discomfort, patient was also noted to have new
hypoxia to 85% on room air after receiving IV fluids, and was
placed on nasal cannula with improvement of saturation to
mid-90%.  A venous blood gas was obtained and showed a pH of
7.15 and lactate of 6.9.  Due to concern lactic acidosis and
abdominal pain, CT angiography of abdomen was ordered to
rule-out mesenteric ischemia, in addition to CT Torso.
.
In addition, cardiac enzymes were cycled starting at admission,
and patient was found to have elevated troponin to 0.57, with no
baseline for comparison.  His CK was only 117, but MB index was
elevated.  Initially, patient had no ischemic ECG changes, and
only sinus tachycardia.  Cardiology was consulted and
recommended deferring anticoagulation for the moment until
mesenteric ischemia was ruled-out.
.
Of note, patient also had some change in his baseline mental
status per his wife.  Reportedly, he has had this occur in the
past due to opioid therapy.  He is chronically on oxycodone SR
[**Hospital1 **] for diffuse pain related to his malignancy.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient was noted to have progressive
respiratory distress.  ABG was obtained, 7.31/19/405 on 100%
non-rebreather with an arterial lactate of 6.0 .  Patient became
agitated, tachypneic, and began pulling off oxygen mask.  He
denied any pain.  Endotracheal intubation was performed for
progressive respiratory distress.  Post-intubation, patient
required escalating dose of sedation, and received 100mcg
fentanyl and 3mg midazolam.  His non-invasive blood pressure
subsequently fell to 58 systolic.  He received 2 litres of LR
bolus through antecubital IV, and his blood pressure had
marginal improvement to MAP in low 50s.  Peripheral dopamine was
started, with MAPs improving to 65.  With subsequent fluid
boluses, dopamine was downtitrated and turned off.  Central
venous catheter was inserted and demonstrated a CVP of 7.

Previously described numerous metastases are still present in
the
retroperitoneum. The mass anterior to the left kidney measures
22 x 18 mm and has decreased in size (previously was 23 x 27
mm). The mass located posterior to the left kidney measures 22 x
16 mm and is unchanged in size. The mass located posterior to
the right kidney measures 12 x 12 mm and has decreased in size
(previously was 16 x 15 mm).

The liver presents some perfusion abnormalities in the venous
phase, otherwise unremarkable. Spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and
gallbladder are unremarkable. There are no gallstones.
Previously described hypoattenuating lesions in the right kidney
are again noted and probably correspond to cysts. No
hydronephrosis. Visualized intra-abdominal bowel loops are
unremarkable.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Previously described
metastasis anterior to the left iliacus muscle now measures 19 x
12 mm and has decreased in size (it was 21 x 16 mm). Bladder is
unremarkable. There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence
of diverticulitis.

No evidence of peritoneal fluid. The mass described in the
subcutaneous fat on the left side (series 30, image 110) just
superior to the gluteus muscles, now measures 12 mm and has
decreased in size (it was 15 mm previously).

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no definite osteolytic or
osteoblastic lesions.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY: There is diffuse atheromatous disease with mural
thrombus and calcification of the abdominal aorta and branches,
including iliac arteries. There is no evidence of mesenteric
ischemia. The origin of the celiac artery is stenotic.

Origin of SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and renal arteries are patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of abscess, cholecystitis, mesenteric ischemia or
perforation.
2. Stenosis of the celiac trunk.
3. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with mural thrombus in the
aorta
4. Previously described soft tissue masses are again noted, with
decrease in size in some of them as described above.
5. Unchanged right kidney cysts.

Findings were communicated over the phone to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 17:05
on [**2200-7-2**].
Please also refer to clip number [**Serial Number 77248**] for more images and
chest report.



The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to MICU for lactic acidosis and was
intubated due to progressively increasing respiratory demands in
order to compensate for metabolic alkalosis.  Due to
intermittent episodes of hypotension and lactic acidosis, sepsis
was a presumed diagnosis and a central venous line was placed.
Cultures were obtained but did not demonstrate any source of
infection.  Presumed source was pulmonary due to infiltrates on
chest x-ray.  He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and
oral vancomycin to cover C. difficile.  CT Angiography of the
adomen did not demonstrate any compromised abdominal vasculature
or ischemic bowel.  There was also no intra-abdominal pocket of
infection evident radiographically.

Patient was also found to have positive cardiac enzymes during
the course of the admission.  Due to concern for ischemia, he
was started on heparin and cardiology was consulted.
Ultimately, it was felt that the biomarker elevation was
secondary to demand ischemia rather than a thrombotic process
and heparin was stopped.

On the night when patient expired, he was coded for 1 hour.  He
was transiently hypotensive and then developed monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia, although he maintained a pulse.  He was
given 300mg amiodarone and then went into PEA.  Chest
compression was started.  He maintained oxygenation during the
code.  Rhythm alternated from PEA to junctional rhythm with
pulse.  He received several doses of atropine and epinephrine.
Family was notified of his critical condition and after much
discussion, it was decided to make patient comfort measures, and
subsequently expired.

Pathology:
[**2114-5-24**]
 Lung, right upper lobe, lobectomy (G-P):
a.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; see synoptic
report #1.
b.  Immunostains of the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin
7 and TTF-1, and negative for cytokeratin 20 and HepPar1, with
satisfactory controls. This immunophenotype supports a pulmonary
origin.
 Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (Q):
a.  Mild chronic cholecystitis.
b.  No calculi present.
 Liver, segment 4A, resection (R-U):
a.  Hepatocellular carcinoma, well-differentiated; see synoptic
report #2.
b.  Immunostains of the tumor cells are diffusely and strongly
positive for HepPar1, with satisfactory controls, supporting the
diagnosis

Imaging:
[**2114-5-24**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

[**2114-5-28**] Cardiac cath: Selective coronary angiogrpahy in this
right dominant system revealed one vessel coronary disease. The
LMCA was free of angiographically apparent CAD. The LAD had
minimal luminal irregularities. The LCX had a 30% proximal
lesion. The RCA had a 99% mid vessel stenosis and an aneuysm of
the ostium which was present at baseline.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed nromal systemic blood pressure.

3. Successful stenting of a a heavily calcified mid RCA lesion
with a
2.5 X 8 mm Driver and a 2.5 X 12 mm Vision bare metal stents
(see PTCA
comments for detail).

[**2114-5-28**] echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal to mid inferior akinesis and inferoseptal and
inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall EF 40-45%. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is mildly elevated. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate focal left ventricular dysfunction
consistent with CAD. Mild right ventricular dilation with
preservation of apical motion (base less well seen), mild
pulmonary hypertension, and septal flattening. Cannot rule out
pulmonary embolism.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-4**],
the focal wall motion abnormalities and right ventricular
findings are new.  \


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77625**] was admitted to the hepatobiliary surgery service
and was followed closely by the thoracic surgery service after
his surgeries on [**5-24**].  For details of the surgeries, please
refer to the operative notes.  He was kept in the PACU for close
monitoring post op.  He had an epidural in place which was held
due hypotension.  He had 2 chest tubes in place as well as an
abdominal JP drain.  On POD 1 ([**5-25**]) his chest tubes were placed
to water seal, the epidural was continued and he was stable for
transfer to the floor.  On POD 2 ([**5-26**]), he was doing well and
his pain was well controlled with the epidural/PCA and chest
tube #1 was removed and the 2nd chest tube was placed to bulb
suction.

On POD 3 ([**5-27**]) he was started on clear liquid diet.  Overnight
he had acute mental status changes with increased O2
requirements and respiratory distress.  EKG showed new Afib and
Lopressor was given with no change.  ABG showed decreased PaO2.
CXR demonstrated increased left lung opacity.  He was
transferred to the SICU for further management.  He was
intubated and diltiazem IV drip for afib was started.  Cardiac
enzymes revealed increased troponins with new ischemia on EKG. A
Heparin drip and pressors were started. IV antibiotics were
started for possible sepsis.

Cardiology was consulted and he was taken emergently to the cath
lab for a PTCA and stenting (bare metal)of RCA on the morning of
POD 4 ([**5-28**]).  He was started on aspirin, plavix and was
maintained on integrelin x 18 hours post procedure.  Lower
extremity US which were negative for DVT and a bronchoscopy
which was clear.  He remained intubated on POD 5 ([**5-29**]).  The
epidural was d/c'd on POD 6 ([**5-30**]).

Overnight he had a acute change in neurological exam where he
was only moving his LUE to sternal rub and not moving his RUE
and had R pupil > L pupil.  Sedation (versed & propofol)was
turned off. A stat head CT was done which showed no evidence of
acute intracranial pathology. Two units of PRBC were transfused
for a hct of 25.8. Neuro exam improved. He was slowly weaned off
of pressors and given lasix for volume overload. CXR showed
Asymmetrical interstitial edema affecting the left lung to a
greater degree than the right. Nebs were given. A low dose
propofol drip was used for agitation. He was weaned off the vent
on [**6-2**].

On [**6-2**], he was transferred out of the SICU to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10
(med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit) where he continued to improve. The CT was d/c'd
without incident. CXR on [**6-3**] showed persistent right-sided
moderate-to-large pneumothorax, unchanged and left-sided
effusion and left basilar atelectasis persisted. Breath sounds
were diminished on the left.  O2 was weaned off. He was assisted
OOB. The foley was removed and diet was advanced. Vicodin was
used for pain with break thru dilaudid. It was noted that he had
periods of forgetfulness. PT declared him safe for discharge
home as he was ambulatory and able to do stairs.

On [**6-6**], the JP drain was removed. Vital signs and labs were
stable. He was ambulatory and tolerating a regular diet. Follow
up appointments with Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5795**] were made as
well as with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Oncology). A follow up appointment with
Cardiology was to be made.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyponatremia:
Patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit
for closer monitoring. He received hypertonic saline, and was
carefully monitored as his sodium was corrected nicely to his
goal of 125-126, taking care not to correct no more than [**10-30**]
mEq in the first 24 hours. His hypertonic saline was
discontinued  and he continued with fluid restriction and a high
salt diet. He was monitored on telemetry and neurological checks
were completed frequently. It was felt that he had SIADH, given
that his hyponatremia worsened initially with intravenous
fluids, his low urine osmolality, and his euvolemic state. Due
to his known brain metastases and concern over worsening edema
and risk of seizures, he was treated with keppra and steroids to
minimize the edema and seizure risk.
- The nephrology team was consulted and also assisted with
management of the patient's hyponatremia.
.
# Small cell lung cancer: Patient had recently completed cycle 1
of cisplatin and irinotecan on day of admission. His allopurinol
was continued.
Outpatient radiation oncology appointment was set up in
[**Hospital1 1474**], closer to the patient's home, for the week following
his discharge.
- He was continued on keppra and steroids, which were slowly
tapered down, for his known brain metastases.
- His chemotherapy was held due to continued diarrhea and
neutropenia.
- Patient was neutropenic, but his cell counts trended upward
prior to discharge and he was no longer neutropenic at that
time. He had no fevers or signs of infection while neutropenic.
.
# Diarrhea: The patient noted diarrhea that was worst during his
first few days of hospitalization. Studies for c. difficile were
negative, and his diarrhea was managed with immodium as needed.
It resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Patient initially was hypertensive, and his home
medications of atenolol and lisinopril were continued. However,
during his course his blood pressure was on the low side, so
these medications were held.
.
# Bipolar disorder/Anxiety:  Depakote had been discontinued 1
week prior admission due to concern over possible interaction
with chemotherapy. Although hyponatremia was felt to have some
role in the patient's agitation, it was also possible that the
discontinuation of depakote was also playing a role. Psychiatry
was consulted and followed along during the patient's stay, and
recommended seroquel and ativan to assist with his agitation. He
was not felt to be manic during his stay.
Follow up appointments with psychiatry were coordinated and set
up as well.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Patient was noted to have elevated blood
sugars, which were felt to likely be secondary to steroids. His
steroids were tapered down, but the hyperglycemia persisted.
Insulin and glucometer teaching were completed with the patient
and his wife, and he was sent out on NPH and a sliding scale of
insulin.
.
# Thrush: Patient noted to have thrush, thought to be secondary
to steroids. Nystatin swish and swallow cleared his thrush
nicely and was continued along with clotrimazole.
.
# Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition:
  - Heart-healthy diet was followed
  - 1L fluid restriction
.
# Prophylaxis:
  - Proton pump inhibitor was initiated due to steroid use.
  - Subcutaneous heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis.
  - His home statin was continued for cardiac prevention.
  - Physical therapy worked with patient and he was felt to be
safe for discharge to home.

Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old gentleman with previous
diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.  He initially
underwent chemotherapy
and radiation therapy and he was at that time refusing surgery.
However, a few months after completing his chemotherapy and
radiation, he presented with malaise, cough and episodes of
hemoptysis and after further discussion, he
decided to proceed with a left pneumonectomy for an extensive
tumor that was in the left upper lobe but also invading the
airway.


Past Medical History:
1.  COPD.
2.  Squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer, diagnosed in [**2145**]
status post radiation chemotherapy.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Right knee arthroplasty.
6.  Aortic thrombus, diagnosed in [**9-/2145**] for which he is on
Coumadin.


Social History:
He is married.  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a former
corrections officer.  He has less than 10-pack-year smoking
history; however, he did smoke a pipe on a daily basis up until
[**2145**].  He does drink glass of scotch approximately every
other day.  He believes that while doing some renovations at his
place of work he may have been exposed to asbestos for a limited
time.

CXR:
[**2146-4-21**]: Status post left pneumonectomy with air-fluid level at
approximately the AP window level. No radiographic evidence of
post-surgical complications. Expected subcutaneous emphysema in
the left chest wall.
[**2146-4-19**]: The current study demonstrates gradual increase in the
opacification of the left hemithorax with no change in the
position of the mediastinum, findings expected after
pneumonectomy. On the other hand,there is increase in the
subcutaneous air compared to the prior study that might be
partially related to removal of the chest tube. There is no
abnormality seen in the right hemithorax. The post-pneumonectomy
stem appears to be unremarkable within the limitation of this
radiograph.
[**2146-4-19**]: No evidence of mediastinal widening or shift. Minimal
atelectatic change at the right base.




Brief Hospital Course:
[**4-18**] Pt was admitted for Left pneumonectomy for NSCLC.  The
procedure was without complication, pt was take to the SICU
post-operatively and extubated at that time. Pain was controlled
with and Epidural catheter, NGT was in place and to suction,
vital signs were monitered per the SICU routine.
On POD1 the NGT was d/c'd, pt remained NPO, pressors were weaned
and orders were placed for floor transfer. The left red rubber
drain was removed
POD2 He tolerated a clear liquid diet, the fluid restriction was
increased to 1.5L
He had an episode of atrial fibrillation converted to sinus
rhythm with beta-blockers and amiodarone.
POD3 he tolerated a regular diet.  He had brief atrial
fibrillation with heart rates in 140's.  He continued the
amiodarone drip.  The epidural was removed and was started on PO
Dilaudid and toradol with good pain control.  The foley was
removed. He voided without difficulty.
POD4 He was seen by physical therapy.  He remained in atrial
fibrillation.  His home coumadin was restarted.
POD5 Pt converted to sinus, his coumadin was dosed, INR was
checked, pain was contreolled with PO medications, ambulated
POD6 Remained in sinus rhythum, determined that the patient
deemed stable for discharge. At the time of discharge the
patient was in normal sinus rhythum, vital signs were stable,
pain was well controlled, pt was voiding, having bowel
movements, and able to ambulate without assistance.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91948**] is a 75yo male with
unremarkable PMH who presents today for evaluation after a
screening CXR revealed a new 4-5cm mass in the right lower lobe.
This was further evaluated with CT scan which was reviewed at
today's visit. He denies any symptoms currently, specifically
denying cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss,
chest pain, or fever/chills. Ofnote, on a PET CT, there was an
incidental finding of a 6-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm for which
he will undergo repair after this hospitalization. A
transbronchial biopsy with pathology
demonstrating non-small cell carcinoma was done and subsequent
cervical mediastinoscopy revealed negative nodes.  He presents
now for surgical excision.

2. Complete mucus impaction of the right middle lobe bronchus,
with resulting right middle lobe collapse. A small collection of
air and fluid may be a small consolidation. Abscess is unlikely
given short timecourse.
3. Left focal consolidations and ground-glass opacities
throughout the left upper and lower lobes, compatible with
multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
4. Reexpansion pulmonary edema within the right upper lobe.
5. Mild post-surgical air and fluid within the right pleural
cavity.
6. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema extending along the right
chest wall and lower right neck, as seen on prior radiographs.

[**2117-3-23**] CXR :
1. Slightly improved right lung aeration, but persistent
moderate asymmetric edema is unusual for this long postoperative
course.
2. Unchanged moderate right pleural effusion.
3. Improved subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right chest
wall.
4. Small residual right basilar pneumothorax


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a right VATS with right lower
lobectomy.  He tolerated the  procedure well and returned to the
PACU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics
after fluid resuscitation and his pain was in adequate control.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his epidural catheter
was removed on post op day #1 and he was able to cough and use
his incentive spirometer effectively but his volumes gradually
decreased and eventually desaturated to the mid 80's. He has a
chest CTA done to rule out PE which was negative but he had
right middle lobe collapse due to secretions.  He was
transferred to the SICU for close observation and vigorous
pulmonary toilet.

He eventually required bronchoscopy and lavage to remove his
secretions and following that was able to maintain saturations
in the 94% range on 2.5 to 3 liters. He remained afebrile and
his WBC gradually decreased from 15K to 10K.  He was transferred
back to the Surgical floor to complete his recovery. He has an
effective cough and continues to use his incentive spirometer.

Due to his prolonged hospitalization he was evaluated by the
Physical Therapy service due to his prolonged oxygen needs as
well as his limited mobility. They felt that he was able to go
home with VNA, home PT and oxygen.  His ambulatory saturations
off of oxygen was 85%.  He eventually was able to maintain
saturations of 96% on 2 liters of oxygen.

His right chest port sites were healing well and he was
tolerating a regular, diabetic diet with blood sugars in the
170-190 range.  His metformin will be restarted.  He was
discharged to home on [**2117-2-22**] on home O2 and VNA services.  He
will follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in [**2-19**] weeks.

lower wedge resection


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a biopsy-proven
non-small cell lung cancer arising from the right upper lobe.
The patient's recent history dates to an XRay done in [**3-/2161**] for
a R humeral fracture that disclosed an
abnormality in the right upper lobe. A CT scan of the chest at
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2161-5-11**] shows a 2.6-cm nodule in the right
lung apex.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy.  The nodule in the right upper lobe is
spiculated.  There is also a right lower lobe nodule that is 7 x
9 mm and, in addition, a nodule within the left lateral major
fissure that measures 2.1 cm.  Finally, there is a left lower
lobe nodule that is 6 x 8 mm.  A subsequent PET-CT scan on
[**2161-5-29**] shows the right upper lobe nodule to be FDG avid,
although an SUV is not provided on this report.  No other
abnormal hypermetabolic focus was seen in the chest.
Specifically, the other nodules noted on the CT scan were FDG
non-avid.  She is being admitted for Right upper lobectomy.

Past Medical History:

states that on her father's side many family members had cancer,
but none with lung cancer.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 59907**] was admitted on [**2161-9-7**] for Right video-assisted
thoracoscopy -converted to right thoracotomy. Decortication of
right lung. Right upper lobectomy.
Right middle lobe wedge. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy. The
procedure was complicated by near-complete pleural symphysis.
Coagulopathy. She had 1300 mL intraoperative blood loss.

Respiratory: she was transferred to SICU intubated.  She
remained intubated overnight and was successfully extubated
POD1.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were continued

Chest-tube: 2 right chest tubes were removed once the drainage
decreased.  No pneumothoraces following CT removal.

CXR; she was followed by serial chest film. the right middle
lobe hematoma improved. Atlectasis was seen.

Cardiac: she had an episode of atrial fibrillation HR 140's
which she converted to sinus rhythm 50-60's with IV lopressor.
She was converted to PO lopressor and remained in sinus rhythm.

HR in the 20's but quickley returned to her baseline of 60.s
She remained hemodynamically stable.

GI: she had intermittent nausea. Once the narcotics were stopped
her nausea improved. She tolerated a regular diet once the
nausea resolved.  A KUB showed nonspecific dilitation and stool
in the rectal vault.  Cathartics were administered and symptoms

ALLERGIES:  Ampicillin, Zocor, and .............

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies smoking.  She denies ethanol
abuse.  Patient has a reversible heart defect post CABG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent the lung resection
under wedge.  Unfortunately postoperatively she had pulmonary
toilet issues and was desaturating most likely secondary to
poor inspiration and her underlying disease.  She was
retaining CO2 and was kept in the PACU for the next day.
Underwent vigorous chest PT and pulmonary toilet.  She was
sating well and she was on Lopressor for her heart
conditions.  She spiked to 102.2, and cultures sent off were
significant for urinary tract infection for which she was
started on Cipro 500 mg po bid.

She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #2 and
did well.  She was sating 90% on room air to 2 liters without
any incident, and she was discharged home with prescriptions
for Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Colace 100 mg po bid, Tylenol #3
tablets, not Percocet secondary to her underlying respiratory
dysfunction and we want to avoid oversedation, she is given
80 of those, Cipro 500 mg tablets which she will get three

Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchial stent revision

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90972**] is a 72 yo F with a history of stage IIIb squamous
cell carcinoma (dx [**1-/2166**], s/p chemo/radiation in [**State **],
recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right mainstem and
bronchus intermedius requiring stenting). She came to the
hospital today for scheduled bronchial stent revision. Per
report she had a rigid bronchoscopy which showed that the
previously placed silicon stent in her right mainstem bronchus
was in good position but the lumen was clogged up with necrotic
tissue/ tumor and secretion. Therapeutic aspiration was
performed and a wash was done. [**Doctor Last Name **] ballon was used to dilate
the completely occluded RML. There were no clear operative
complications and blood loss was estimated at 5cc. However while
in the PACU the patient had persistent hypotension to the 70s
systolic and she received a total of 2.5 liters of fluid. She
was also given 40mg of solumedrol out of concern for adrenal
insufficiency (was recently on a short course of prednisone
several weeks ago, not currently on steroids). She was not given
any antibiotics. At the time of initial MICU resident evaluation
in the PACU the patient was afebrile, HR 74 SBP 70/52, 96% on
4liters. She was mentating well and oriented X3

ECHO [**2166-7-31**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion

CHEST CT [**2166-8-1**]:
1.  Near complete right lung opacification is largely due to a
combination of
volume loss and infection. The right pleural effusion is
small-moderate,
extending to the apex. The PleurX catheter ends in the right
posterior
costophrenic sulcus within a small amount of fluid.

2.  Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
The aerated
left lung is clear with mild emphysema.

3.  Patent but narrowed right mainstem bronchus.  Narrowed
bronchus
intermedius and right upper lobe bronchus terminating abruptly.
Soft tissue
encasing the bronchus is likely consistent with known malignancy
and is best
evaluated with contrast.

4.  12-mm left pericardial lymph node.


Brief Hospital Course:
72F with stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma (diagnosed [**1-/2166**],
s/p chemo/XRT) recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right
mainstem and bronchus intermedius requiring stenting and
multiple IP procedures, with R PleurX catheter in place,
transferred to ICU for hypotension post-bronchoscopy, currently
off pressors.

ACTIVE ISSUES

#) Hypotension: Patient with baseline blood pressures in the
systolic 80s-low 100s per her report and OMR notes.  She was
started on neosynephrine, which was eventually able to be weaned
for goal SBPs 90-low 100s.  She was emperically covered with
vancomycin and zosyn but all cultures were negative and she was
narrowed to augmentin to cover for post-obstructive PNA, however
re-started back on vanc/zosyn when she decompensated after a
further bronch procedure.  TTE showed no evidence of tamponade,
but showed a trivial pericardial effusion.  After transfer to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she did not require pressors and her hypotension resolved.
The differential was thought to include sepsis secondary to
post-obstructive PNA, but more likely SIRS response
post-bronchoscopy. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with
normal AM cortisol. Patient was weaned off pheylephrine,
midodrine, and fludrocortisone and her BP has been stable on the
floor.

#) Possible post-obstructive pneumonia:  Pt with tenuous
respiratory status, spiked fever during ICU stay, and treated
presumptively for possible post-obstructive PNA.   Completed a 2
week course of antibiotics including vancomycin/Zosyn x 8 days
(in addition to Augmentin x5 days earlier).

#) Dyspnea/Respiratory failure (hypercarbic and hypoxemic):
Thought to be likely multifactorial in etiology, in setting of
lung cancer, obstructive lesion, RUL collapse, pleural effusion,
possible post-obstructive pneumonia, and ? underlying COPD.  No
previous diagnosis of COPD, though imaging this admission has
been suggestive of COPD.  She received Advair and albuterol nebs
with good relief. She has PleurX in place for palliative
drainage of her right pleural effusion.  This is draining very
minimal fluid and can now be checked qweekly (last drained
Thursday [**8-7**]).   The patient was offered palliative
thoracentesis for the left pleural effusion by interventional
pulmonary and she has declined.

She has continued O2 requirement of [**3-7**] L NC and desats easily
with minimal exertion.  Even sitting up to eat can cause
dyspnea.  This is not expected to improve much further,
unfortunately, and care should be focused on relieving symptoms.
 Have discussed with interventional pulmonary and it is unlikely
that further procedures would greatly change her course given
her end-stage disease (see goals of care below)

We have initiated oral morphine for relief of dyspnea and she
feels it does help her symptoms somewhat.  She does need
encouragement to take this regularly.  Would offer it to her 30
min before planned activity, such as bathing, ambulation.  Offer
at bedtime as well.

#) Lung Cancer: Stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma.  Not a
candidate for further radiation therapy.  No further
interventions possible by interventional pulmonary for her
extensive disease, including right mainstem bronchial lesion.
Seen by oncology in-house who felt that benefit of further outpt
chemo would likely be limited.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (hospitalist) spoke
with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58562**] at [**Hospital3 **] [**Company 2860**], who agreed
that she is a poor candidate for further systemic therapy.

#) Anemia of chronic disease: currently stable with Hct 23-24.
No need to check regular labs at this point.

#) Depression: Continue home regimen sertraline.

#) Goals of care: Pt expressed interest in palliative
care/hospice options and she was seen by our palliative care
team.  Palliative care was consulted and they recommended oral
morphine prn dyspnea, as above.  The patient expressed an
interest in going to rehab following this stay, but is open to
pursuing hospice care in the near future.  (unfortunately we
discovered her insurance does not have a hospice benefit).   Pt
is aware her overall prognosis is poor.  Her treatment is
palliative only, focused on relieving symptoms and helping her
regain mobility if possible.  If her condition should decline,
she should be offered the option of comfort-focused care (rather
than transfer to hospital), with the goal of aggressive symptom
relief and a focus on quality of life.  Further hospitalizations
would likely not reverse the course of her illness, as she is a
poor candidate for further invasive procedures (such as
interventional pulmonary).  Her code status is DNR/DNI.

#) Patient coping, family stressors: Pt was most recently living
in [**State 108**], but traveled back to MA to support her son who is
currently undergoing bone marrow transplant at [**Hospital1 18**].  Her
ex-husband (father of her two sons) recently died several months
ago and this has been an additional stressor.  She met with SW
several times during this stay as well as with palliative care.
She is close with her two sons (including a healthy son living
in [**Name (NI) 32775**], MA).  She could benefit from continued SW support.
She also received Reiki session for relaxation and seemed to
benefit from this as well.

[**2113-10-18**] CXR :
In comparison with the study of [**10-17**], this upright view shows at

least two air-fluid levels in the right hemithorax.  Presumably,
these are
related to the recent surgery and at least one of these
represents a loculated collection in or adjacent to the
mediastinum.  Extensive post-surgical changes are again seen in
the right hemithorax.  The left lung is clear and hyperexpanded
with blunting of the costophrenic angle.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 37080**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a redo right thoracotomy with
right lower lobectomy.  She tolerated the procedure well and
returned to the PACU in stable condition. She had some sinus
bradycardia intraop therefore had cardiac enzymes cycled post
op.  Her troponin were normal x 3 and she had no EKG changes.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor her chest tubes
remained in place until the drainage decreased and she was
attempting to use her incentive spirometer.  She desaturated on
post op day #2 and was transferred to the ICU for more pulmonary
toilet as her remaining right lung was collapsed.  A
bronchoscopy was done on [**2113-10-13**] to evaluate her airway and
thick tenacious secretions were found in the bronchus
intermedius and removed.  She improved from a respiratory
standpoint thereafter.

She was seen by the Geriatric service as she had some confusion
and dizziness prior to transfer.  They felt that her neuro exam
was that of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) as opposed to
Alzheimer's as she had no functional impairment and was not
dependent.  The Aricept can cause orthostasis and would not be
effective with MCI therefore was stopped.  She gradually
improved and had no more confusion or dizziness.

Her chest xrays were followed daily and she underwent another
bronchoscopy on [**2113-10-16**] and had secretions in both the right and
left main stem which were aspirated.  Her nebulizer treatments
were increased and she remained afebrile.

From an ID standpoint she had some dysuria after the Foley
catheter was removed and was started on Cipro.  Her culture grew
>100K Citrobacter.  She also had BAL's sent with each
bronchoscopy and the antibiotic was changed to Levaquin for more
gram positive coverage.  Her WBC has been as high as 27K and as
low as 15K post op, currently 20K without any bands in her
differential. Her lungs are clearer and her wound is healing
well.  She has no evidence of phlebitis or any skin problems and
the elevated WBC is unclear as she clinically looks well.  She
will complete a 7 day course of antibiotics which will end on
[**2113-10-23**].   She's tolerating a regular diet and working with
physical therapy so that she may return home.

She was discharged to rehab on [**2113-10-19**] and will follow up in the
Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks or sooner if needed.

[**2166-7-6**] CXR :
Status post removal of a left-sided chest tube from the
pneumonectomy cavity.  The height of the air-fluid level is
comparable to the previous examination.  Remnant gas collections
in the left lateral chest wall and the cervical soft tissues.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  Unchanged normal appearance of
the right lung.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken the Operating
Room where he underwent a left pneumonectomy.  he tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable condition. He
had an epidural catheter placed for pain management which was
effective.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and underwent
vigorous pulmonary toilet and remained free of any pulmonary
complications.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress.  His chest tube was removed on post op day #2 as
was his epidural catheter.  He was placed on scheduled Tylenol
and Dilaudid orally for pain. Serial chest xrays showed the
expected fluid progression in the cavity.  He was tolerating a
diabetic diet and ambulating independently.  His preadmission
Coumadin was started on [**2166-7-6**] at his home dose and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
will follow his INR which was 1.2 on [**2166-7-8**].

Of note, his voice seemed a bit hoarse post op and he had a
digital videostroboscopy performed on [**2166-7-8**] which showed an
immobile left vocal cord.  He will return in a few weeks to the
[**Hospital **] Clinic for medialization.  In the interim he underwent a
video swallow along with a complete speech and swallow exam
which showed that although his vocal cords are not adducting
fully, his laryngeal vestibule and epiglottis are functioning as
expected and diet modification is not needed at this time.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in a few weeks.

Following completion of his swallow evaluation he was discharged
to home on a regular diet and will have VNA services for
cardiopulmonary assessment along with INR checks.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7228**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating
Room where he underwent a left thoracotomy with left upper
lobectomy.  Please see formal Op note for details.  He tolerated
the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
 He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well
controlled with an epidural catheter.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress. His chest tubes were draining minimally, without
air leak and were removed on post op day # 2.  His epidural
catheter was also removed and his pain was controlled with
standing Tylenol and occasional Oxycodone.  He was up and
walking initially with Physical Therapy and eventually he was
ambulating independently.  He remained free of any pulmonary
complications post op.

His narcotic pain meds were minimized as he developed
constipation post op, requiring Dulcolax and magnesium citrate
which were effective. He was tolerating a regular diet without
difficulty and MiraLax was added to his regime.  After an
uncomplicated recovery he was discharged to home on [**2136-4-23**] and
will follow up in 2 weeks in the Thoracic Clinic.

Widespread subcutaneous emphysema persists. With the exception
of the change in pneumothorax, there are no other relevant
changes since the recent radiograph of earlier the same date.

[**2164-1-6**] No obvious PTX (difficult to assess due to subQ air),
[**Doctor Last Name **] tube in place
[**2164-1-3**] Slight increase in size of small left apical
pneumothorax.
[**2164-1-3**] Generalized atelectasis in the left lung persists.
Small left apical pneumothorax is larger today than yesterday,
apical pleural tube in place.  Persistent subcutaneous emphysema
in the left axilla and anterior chest wall.  Right lung clear.
Heart size top normal, still shifted to the left of
midline,reflecting atelectasis on the left.
[**2164-1-1**] Two left-sided chest tubes are again seen with diffuse
left-sided
subcutaneous emphysema extending to the right side of the neck
and in the
right lateral chest wall. The amount of subcutaneous emphysema
makes it
difficult to assess for a focal infiltrate on the left.
[**2163-12-31**]:  Marked increase in amount of subcutaneous emphysema.

[**2163-12-30**]: The left apical pneumothorax is still present, appears
to be unchanged or slightly increased. There is slight increase
in the subcutaneous air in the left hemithorax. The right lung
is unremarkable. There is no appreciable pleural effusion seen.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left-sided cardiac
atelectasis is slightly worse but still minimal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3646**] was admitted on [**2163-12-29**] for Sleeve left upper
lobectomy (reanastomosis of
left lower lobe bronchus to left mainstem bronchus), mediastinal
lymph node dissection, intercostal muscle flap buttress.  She
was extubated in the operating room, monitored in the PACU prior
to transfer to the floor.  She had 2 chest tubes anterior apical
with a persistent airleak and a posterior basilar were to
waterseal. The acute pain service managed her pain with a
Bupivacaine/Dilaudid Epidural with good control.  On POD1 she
responded to a IV fluid challenge for low urine output.  Chest
film showed small basilar effusion/atelectasis for which
pulmonary toilet was continued The anterior chest tube airleak
persist.  On POD2 she developed increased increased subcutaneous
emphysema, concern for airway dehiscence and anastomotic leak.
She was transferred to the SICU for bronchoscopy revealed no
evidence of the dehiscence or any anastomotic leak with saline
instilled. The chest-tubes were placed to suction.  She
transferred back to the floor in stable condition on 100% O2 via
nasal cannula. On POD3 She spiked a fever to 101.2 was
pancultured and started on IV antibiotics. The epidural was
removed and converted to PO pain medication with good control.
On POD4 the basilar chest tube was removed.  She was gently
diuresed. Her Crepitus slowly improved.  POD5 the chest tube was
placed to water-seal a chest x-ray showed a stable left apical
pneumothorax and left lower lobe atelectasis.  She was followed
by physical therapy. She was followed by serial chest films,
pulmonary toilet continued, tolerated a regular diet and her
pain was well controlled with PO Dilaudid.  On POD 7 the
pneumovac was replaced with a pneumostat.  A post CXR showed no
increase in PTX/effusion.  The patient continued to ambulate
well.  In the afternoon, she c/o chest pain when ambulating. An
EKG was done which was normal.  In addition one set of cardiac
enzymes was normal was well. On POD 8 the patient will be
discharged to rehab and will have VNA for her pneumostat upon
completion of her rehab. Her Pneumostat is functioning well and
there is no apparent leak.  Output is minimal (70 cc/day).  CXR
shows no PTX.

Chief Complaint:
S/p arrest in the OR during IP stent procedure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left main stem stent placement.
Endotracheal intubation.
Left femoral tripple lumen catheter placement.

History of Present Illness:
69 y/o F with PMHX of COPD and Small Cell Lung Cancer (diagnosed
[**2159**]) s/p XRT/chemo/tumor debridement/R mainstem bronchus stent
placement ([**2164**]) and recent LUE DVT on Coumadin who initially
presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on [**3-27**] with 3-4 episodes of
hemoptysis, increased cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.
She was started on IV SoluMedrol 125mg IV q6hrs, Nebs and
tessalon pearles. She was supratherapeutic with an INR of 4.1
and Coumadin was held. CTA was negative for PE and revealed
right mainstem stent with distal intraluminal narrowing or tumor
effusion, mediastinal and subcarinal confluent metastatic
lymphadenopathy. Decision was made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
bronch and IP evaluation.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and was continued on steroids, nebs and
cough suppressants.  She went for flexible bronchoscopy on [**3-30**]
which revealed normal trachea, extensive tumor at carina
obstructing both mainstem bronchi, extrinsic mediastinal
compression of L mainstem and unable to visualize stent in right
mainstem due to intraluminal tumor.
Pt was taken to the OR on [**4-1**] and had stent placed in the left
mainstem with good result.  There was attempted argon plasma
coagulation inside of the right stent to remove intraluminal
obstruction.  During this procedure, pt became progressively
hypoxic, bradycardic and loss of pulse at approx 3:38pm. CPR was
started immediately and pt received a total of 2mg of epi.
After approximately 2-3minutes of CPR, rhythm was checked and
there was a palpable pulse with HR >100 and sbp >180.  TEE was
performed and showed bubbles in the right atrium suggestive of
APC related air embolism but no RV dilation suggestive of acute
PE.  Oxygen sats recovered into the 90s, right femoral a-line
and left femoral CVL was placed.  Pt was given an additional
bolus of Midazolam and some neosynephrine for BP support prior
to transfer to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was intubated and sedated with HR >100
and BP 140/90s.  Sedation was rapidly weaned and pt was clearly
responding to commands and moving all extremities.

Past Medical History:
1. Small Cell lung cancer - diagnosed in [**2159**] and recurred in
[**2161**]. Initially started 6 weeks of XRT, followed by multiple
regimens of chemo. Has been off chemo for the last 4 months
""because CT scans have been stable."" Last bronchoscopy was in
[**2165-12-23**] - small amounts of granulation tissue seen in
stent.
2. Recent LUE DVT (mid-[**2166-2-20**]) - L arm port was changed,
after which she developed dramatic swelling from shoulder to
wrist; UENIs confirmed LUE DVT. Coumadin 5mg was started.
3. COPD - longstanding, unknown date of diagnosis
4. Lupus - diagnosed 8 years ago after work-up for painful knee
and finger joints (L finger joints > R finger joints) - treated
with ""pills"" but not prednisone
5. Shingles infection in T10 dermatome in [**10/2165**] - treated with

[**2166-4-9**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Known treated right upper lobe mass with expected post-treatment

change and soft tissue density seen in a right paramediastinal
location is
stable. New mild bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise no
significant
interval change with no focal consolidation, and pulmonary
vascularity within normal limits. No new abnormality involving
cardiomediastinal contours.  Stable appearance of bilateral
bronchial stents and port with tip terminating within the upper
SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2166-4-7**] Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS
There is a linear region of decreased diffusion within the right

frontal lobe, predominantly involving the cortex and subcortical
white matter, as well as multiple additional punctate foci of
decreased diffusion within the biparieto-occipital lobes,
including extending into the splenium of the corpus callosum on
the right. There is an additional focus of abnormal slow
diffusion within the inferior aspect of the right cerebellar
hemisphere, measuring 1.5 cm, with associated brisk enhancement.
There is [**Doctor Last Name **] enhancement over the right frontal lobe signal
abnormalities described above. All of the regions of decreased
diffusion have associated T2 signal abnormality. There are no
regions of abnormal marrow replacement, despite limitations by
motion artifact. Focus of susceptibility artifact along the
posterior focus likely represents a small calcified dural
plaque. There are multifocal regions of punctate post-embolic
encephalomalacia within the left cerebellar hemisphere
suggesting chronic embolic disease.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal regions of abnormally decreased diffusion, most
prominent
within the right frontal lobe, which has an appearance
suggestive of watershed infarction. The more punctate foci of
decreased diffusion posteriorly suggest multiple small emboli.

2. Well-defined 15 mm focus of enhancement and decreased
diffusion within the right cerebellar hemisphere may represent a
subacute enhancing infarct, but is more concerning for a
metastatic lesion in this patient with lung cancer.
Consideration could be given to neck MRA or CTA to evaluate the
cervical
circulation, though the pattern suggests a proximal source.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o F with PMHx of large mediastinal SCC s/p right mainstem
stenting who presented with recurrent compressive symptoms who
underwent OR placement of left mainstem stent and right mainstem
APC complicated by hypoxia and PEA arrest.
.
Pt thought to have had PEA arrest after rigid bronchoscopy was
removed, subsequent to L main stent placement for SCLC and use
of argon anticoagulation.  She underwent CPR immediately for <1
minute. The etilogy was thought to be air emboli secondarely to
argon coagulation vs. hypoxia. TEE was not done during procedure
due to technical difficulties secondarely to the mediastinal
mass. However, TEE done after arrest showing air bubbles in L
atrium. On admission the A-a gradient with pO2 was of >450 on
100% Fi02 and lactate was 1.7. She was moving all extremities
and following commands. CE were negative x2. Repeat TTE was
normal. Anticoagulation was initially held (For DVT) and patient
was extubated succesfuly 3 days after initial intubation.

Her ventilatory support was minimal, RISBI was <105 with air
leak and she was extuabted 24 hours after procedure.
Unfortunately, she developped stridor and increase number of
secretions in the upper airways with respiratory rate in the 40s
and SpO2 in 70s. She required emergent re-intubation. High-dose
steroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg q 6hrs) were started and
continued for 48 hours and patient was succesfully extubated on
day 3. Steroids were slowly down-tapered.
Due to long standing disease with e/o hyperinflation on CXR and
report of bronchospasm on presentation, she was also treated for
COPD exacerbation with standing and prn nebulizers.

After several days on the medical floor, patient's respiratory
status was not improving.  Interventional pulmonology was
reconsulted.  Pt was taken for flexible bronchoscopy which
showed significant mucus, some of which was removed, and [**Female First Name (un) **]
on the vocal cords.  Thoracentesis was also performed.  800cc
were removed and sent for culture. Culture was still pending at
time of discharge.

LUE DVT: Per PSH report, pt had portacath associated upper
extremity DVT and has been on Coumadin, p/w supratherapeutic
INR.  However, ultrasound on [**3-31**] did not show any DVT. LENIs
were negative. Anticoagulation was held prior to procedure and
re-started 24 hours afterwards (with lovenox) given her
malignancy and higher bleeding risk.  During her hospitalization
there was concern of a cerebellar metastasis of SCLC.  Per
radiology, pt should undergo a repeat MRI in 6 weeks for further
characterization.  Due to h/o DVT and atrial fibrillation as
well as evidence of embolic stroke, anticoagulation was
continued upon discharge.  Primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65126**] was
informed of this and he agreed with the plan.

Tachycardia / SVT : Pt has remained tachycardic since admission,
suspect some component of dehydration and underlying malignancy.
 CTA neg for PE at OSH prior to transfer. LENIs were negative.
Patient was hydrated and tachycardia did not improve. Then, she
had episodes of atrial fibrillation up to 140-150 BPM with
stable BP. She was started on metoprolol and it was titrated up
to 50 mg TID which maintained a HR of 100 as monitored on
telemetry.  Metoprolol was not further uptitrated as sinus
tachycardia was thought to be secondary to her illness.  She was
discharged on this regimen. Would consider uptitration of
metoprolol if rate requies better control.  She was diltiazem
prior to this admission, but it did not control her heart rate
adequately.

SCLC: Pt with SCLC s/p chemo/radiation and now with L and R main
bronchus metal stents. Given that she has already received max
radiation doses plan is to do brachitherapy and chemo as
outpatient.  She will need follow up MRI in 6 weeks for further
charactization of a potential brain metastasis.  Outpatient
providers will also have to reassess whether or not to continue
anticoagulation.  Plan for patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] - It was pleasure to care for you during your
hospitalization.  You were admitted for hematemesis.  You were
to have one of your stents reopened and have another stent
placed in your lungs.  However, shortly after the procedure you
developed very low blood pressure and required ICU
hospitalization.  You were intubated twice.  Upon extubation you
had swelling in your neck impairing your breathing, as well as
severe wheezing.  You were treated with steroids and nebulizers.
 Unfortunately your breathing did not improve so you underwent
another bronchoscopy which showed alot of mucus, some of which
was removed.  You had fluid removed from your lungs also.  Your
vocal cords show a candidal infection (thrush) so you should
continue to gargle with nystatin swish and swallow. You will
require oxygen for some time until your lung function improved.

Also during your hospitalization you were found to have Staph
aureus infection of your blood stream and possibly a Staph
aureus pneumonia.  You will complete a 14 day course of
Vancomycin (antibiotic). You were also found to have a urinary
tract infection for which you are on a second antibiotic called
Bactrim.

You were also treated for atrial fibrillation (irregular heart
rhythm) which requires medication to control the heart rate and
continuation of blood thinners to prevent strokes.  You were
previously on coumadin and this is being switched to lovenox.
Unfortunately, to complicate this matter, a small abnormality
was found in your brain that may be a metastasis of the lung
cancer.  This is not entirely clear.  If it is, you could
potentially have a bleed in the brain.  On the other hand, if
you do not continue with the lovenox treatment, you could have a
stroke from a blood clot formed in the heart, which you may have
already had in the past.  The present plan is to continue you on
blood thinners until we can obtain a repeat MRI to confirm a
metastatic brain tumor.  At that time, the matter of continuing
blood thinners can be readdressed.

Regarding treatment - you should discuss further treatment of
your lung cancer with your pulmonologists and your primary
oncologist.

Many medications were changed during this hospitalization:
- you will start prednisone taper, ipratropium and albuterol for
treatment of COPD
- guifenessin has been added to break up mucus
- bactrim and vancomycin have been added for treatment of
urinary tract infection and blood stream infection
- nystatin swish and swallow for treatment of oral and vocal
throat [**Female First Name (un) **] infection (yeast).  Please gargle with this
medication for most effective treatment.
- metoprolol has been started for better heart rate control.
stop taking diltiazem
- lovenox has been started to thin the blood.  stop taking
coumadin.
- aspirin has been discontinued due to increased risk of
bleeding.
- lorazepam may be used as frequently as every 6 hrs as needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4894**] is a 72 year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of
the lung who was admitted to the hospital for a right
thoracostomy and pneumonectomy. The surgery went well and on
post-operative day 1, the patient's chest tube was removed.  He
was then transferred to the general floor from the ICU.
.
The remainder of his hospital stay was complicated by atrial
fibrillation which began on the morning of [**2172-3-12**] @ 0400. A
cardiology consult was called, and several antiarrhythmic agents
were started. It was not until the morning of [**2172-3-14**] that the
patient converted back into normal sinus rhythm.  He was not
cardioverted electrically prior to this because the procedure
would have required anticoagulation which a post-pneumonectomy
patient should not undergo this early in their recovery.  He was
continued on oral amiodarone and metoprolol on discharge.
Follow-up with cardiology was scheduled for [**2172-3-18**]. Discharge
was [**2172-3-15**] morning.
.
*Of note, on admission, an aspirin 161mg daily was on the
patient's medication list as currently taken. After discussing
with him and his wife, it was discovered that he was not
actually taking this medication. As suggested in the past, this
was likely a good idea for the patient. Aspirin can prevent
heart disease. At his follow-up appointment with cardiology, we
advised him to seek their opinion on his use of daily aspirin.
.
The patient was ambulating, tolerating an oral diet, urinating
well, and cognitively intact at the time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 4894**],

* You were admitted to the hospital for lung surgery and you've
recovered well. Your hospital stay was complicated by an
irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. Cardiology specialists as well as your
surgeons used various anti-arrhythmic medications to break this
irregular beat. After many trials, a regimen was successful and
you converted back to a normal sinus heart rhythm on Saturday
morning ([**2172-3-14**]). You will continue home on this regimen of
amiodarone and metoprolol and see the cardiologists for
follow-up on [**2172-3-18**].
* Continue your incentive spirometry 10 times/hour while awake.
* Check your incisions daily, and report any increased redness
or drainage. Cover the area with a gauze pad if it is draining.
* Your chest tube dressings may be removed 48 hours after
discharge if they are not already fallen off. If the incision
starts to drain, cover it with a clean dry dressing and change
it as needed to keep each site clean and dry.
* You will likely continue to need pain medication once you are
home, but you can begin to wean it over a few weeks as the
discomfort resolves. Make sure that you have regular bowel
movements while on narcotic pain medications as they are
constipating.  Use a stool softener or gentle laxative to stay
regular. We are sending you home with one today.
* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.
* You may take Tylenol 650 mg every 6 hours in between your
narcotic doses, but do not exceed 4000mg in 24 hours. If your
doctor allows you may also take Ibuprofen to help relieve the
pain. Ask at your follow-up appointment if this is acceptable.
* Continue to stay well hydrated and eat well to heal your
incisions.
* Shower daily. Wash with mild soap & water, rinse, and pat dry.
* No tub bathing, swimming, or hot tubs until doctor approved.
* No lotions or creams to incision site.
* Walk at least 4-5 times a day, and gradually increase your
activity as you can tolerate.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
Presenting from OSH for tracheal and esophageal stent placement
secondary to squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Tracheal Y-stent placement [**2150-8-5**]
- Esophageal stent placement [**2150-8-6**]
- Bronchoscopy [**2150-8-7**]


History of Present Illness:
In brief, this patient is a 76 yo M former smoked admitted on
[**8-3**] from [**Hospital6 1597**] for worsening dyspnea and 60 pound
weight loss over 4 months and found to have a moderately
differentiated squamous cell lung CA compressing the right
mainstem bronchus and esophagus. He underwent bronchoscopy that
showed squamous CA with no mets seen on CT head, abdomen/pelvis.
Was treated with a 15 day course of levofloxacin for
post-obstructive PNA and received 3 doses of radiation therapy.
He developed solid food dysphagia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for esophageal stenting, but was determined to need tracheal
stenting first. Tracheal stenting was performed on [**8-5**] followed
by esophageal stenting on [**8-6**], afterwhich he developed atrial
fibrillation. He was started on metoprolol for rate control,
then spontaneously converted back to sinus. He had a CXR that
showed collapse of his RLL and RML with mild aeration of RUL. He
transferred to the MICU to undergo flexible bronchoscopy; RUL
reopened but remainder of bronchus intermedius obscured by
tumor.
.
He was started on a diltiazem gtt which was stopped on [**8-2**] and
transitioned to diltiazem PO; currently in and out of afib/sinus
rhythm. Currently on steroid taper since transfer for COPD
exacerbation. Seen by radiation oncology in consult on [**8-8**];
they recommended sending him back to [**Hospital3 **] to finish
radiation in order to avoid delay of treatment.
.
Esophageal stent is partially occluded but he is tolerating a
ground dysphagia/thin liquids diet.

Past Medical History:
- Lung cancer
- Epilepsy (age [**11-10**] yrs, was on Dilantin and stopped)
- Appendectomy

.
RADIOLOGY
IMAGING:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2150-8-8**]
1:59 PM
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Interval placement of
patent tracheal Y-stent. Worsening of right lower lobe collapse
and consolidation since prior CT (though improved from recent
radiographs), likely due to tumoral involvement and/or
secretions within right lower lobe airways. Similar appearance
of locally invasive hilar/mediastinal mass, consistent with
reported history of squamous cell lung cancer. 3. Increased left
pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation and atelectasis,
consistent with pneumonia and possibly aspiration. Small right
pleural effusion little changed; pleural enhancement noted and
pleural involvement by tumor cannot be excluded. 4. Status post
esophageal stent placement, which is collapsed at its waist, and
nearly completely occluded, with air-fluid levels, proximal and
distal to the waist of the stent. 5. 13 mm left upper lobe
ground glass opacity is nonspecific, and may
represent aspiration, infection, or tumor. 7 mm right upper lobe
nodule.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2150-8-8**] 10:28 AM
Since the previous study, there has been some improvement in the
aeration at the right middle lobe and right base. However, there
remains increased opacity and right-sided pleural effusion in
this location. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The
left lung is clear. There are no pneumothoraces identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with long hx of tobacco smoking, appendectomy, and
epilepsy in youth presenting from OSH after x4 radiation
treatments, 15 day Levofloxacin course for pna, and steroid
taper for COPD exacerbation presenting for tracheal and
esophageal stent placement for lung carcinoma.

1. Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Pt received x4 sessions of XRT
at [**Hospital6 1597**] prior to transfer. During the patient's
admission, he tolerated esophageal and airway stenting, but
developed atrial fibrillation with RVR during his course.  On
discharge to Rehab, the patient will need to continue palliative
XRT at [**Hospital3 **] under the care of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 87328**], MD, who can
be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87329**].

2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Post-stenting, the patient
developed AF with RVR requiring MICU transfer for diltiazem gtt.
 He was converted to a standing oral regimen on transfer to the
general floor, and was noted to be in sinus with 1:1 conduction
for the duration with intermitent episodes of rate-controlled
atrial fibrillation. He will need to continue diltiazem on
discharge. Given multiple recent interventions performed,
aspirin therapy was deferred during his admission, but can be
considered on discharge.

3. COPD exacerbation: Patient was transferred on prednisone for
a presumed COPD exacerbation.  His was stable from a respiratory
standpoint during his admission on a baseline home oxygen
requirement of 2L nc (unchanged from prior to admission), and he
will be discharged on a prednisone taper. The directions for his
prednisone are: Prednisone 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg
daily for 4 days, then STOP

4. Urinary retention: Following tracheal stent placement, the
patient developed urinary retention. A foley catheter was placed
and Tamsulosin was started [**2150-8-6**] with successful voiding trial.

5. Pneumonia: Patient completed a 15 day course of levofloxacin
during his admission.

periaortic position as well as extensive pleural thickening and
left-sided volume loss.

[**2139-10-6**] CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple extra-axial, supratentorial punctate
densities along the sulci may be vascular in origin or could
represent prior cisternogram, however given the clinical history
secondary hemorrhagic metastasic deposits are also included in
the differential.
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, new region of
edema, or new mass effect.
3. Previously described ring-enhancing lesion is not well
demonstrated today, but could be due to differences in
technique. For more sensitive evaluation for metastasic disease
and infarction direct comparison with prior MR, repeat MRI may
be performed as clinically indicated.

[**2139-10-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Allowing for respiratory motion, no large or central
pulmonary embolism
seen.
2. Moderate-sized left loculated and septated hydropneumothorax.
The patient is status post recent procedure (reportedly VATS at
OSH) in the left posterior thorax with skin staples in place and
small locules of subcutaneous gas.
3. Subcutaneous collection in left posterior chest wall deep to
surgical
incision could represent postoperative hematoma although
communication with pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
4. Left upper lobe atelectasis/mass with attenuation of
pulmonary artery and bronchi. Correlation with prior imaging is
recommended.
5. Diffuse abnormality of the colon and rectum with mucosal
enhancement,
submucosal thickening and pericolonic stranding. Findings are
nonspecific and could represent, for example, an infectious
colitis. Ischemic colitis less likely. Trace fluid tracking
along the left paracolic gutter with small fluid in pelvis. No
free air.
6. Multiple sclerotic lesions in the axial skeleton concerning
for metastatic disease in this patient with history of
malignancy. Correlation with prior bone scan or other imaging
recommended. Anterior wedge compression deformity of T12 of
indeterminate chronicity without comparison.
7. Presacral hyperattenuating lesions likely representing
enhancing soft
tissue, the more superior one abutting the sacrum with possible
bony
involvement, concerning for metastases.
8. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, with focal ectasia of
infrarenal
abdominal aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 67yoF with a history of breast cancer and metastatic
non small cell lung cancer who was intubated at an OSH for
respiratory distress and transferred for further management of
respirator failure.

# Respiratory failure: in the setting of known NSCLC. She had
leukocytosis at OSH prior to transfer w/bandemia. Otherwise, CXR
revealed mass and left sided effusion, but no other acute
changes. Exam is w/o evidence of COPD flare and CXR does not
reveal evidence of PNA. Respiratory distress may have been
secondary to primary metabolic acidosis. Unlikely [**12-20**] high tumor
burden causing respiratory failure. CT chest ruled out PE.
Repeated attempts to wean the pt or extubate her were
complicated by tachypnea and high auto PEEP to the 40s only
relieved with sedation of versed and fentanyl gtts in large
amounts. When sedated to this degree, the pt did have
significant drops in her BP requiring pressor support. In the
early afternoon of [**10-10**], given her lack of improvement and
inability to wean from the vent, a family meeting was held and
the pt was made CMO. She was continued on A/C vent settings,
fentanyl and versed gtts titrated to comfort. Pressors were
discontinued. Her family was present in the ICU during this
time. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of these decisions. She was
pronounced at 5:50 pm [**2139-10-10**], the family refused autopsy.
.
# Metabolic acidosis - nongap at time of presentation to OSH ED;
pt did have diarrhea with later positive C diff.; No h/o fevers
and pt had been afebrile prior to admisison but w/leukocytosis
to 33.7 and impressive bandemia and lactate of 3.2. Vent
settings were continually changed based on ABG's. Pt was best
maintained on A/C with large amts of fentanyl and versed gtts.
Her C diff was treated with PO flagyl and vanco.
.
# NSCLC - had XRT to brain and per report had scheduled chemo
prior to admission. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (her outpatient oncologist) was
consulted and continuously involved in her care during her ICU
stay.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Sarcoma of the left lung extending to and including the main
pulmonary artery, as well as the left and right pulmonary
arteries.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2191-3-23**]:
1. Left pneumonectomy with pulmonary artery reconstruction
   using a 20-mm Dacron tube graft.
2. Ligation and division of the patent ductus arteriosus.
3. Flexible bronchoscopy.
4. Mediastinoscopy
5. Intercostal muscle flap buttress to the left bronchial
    stump.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66M w a recently diagnosed pulmonary artery
sarcoma admitted for resection.  Patient was in his usual state
of good health until [**4-/2190**] when he developed a cold while
traveling abroad.  Since then, he has noticed a decrease in
overall stamina.  In [**7-/2190**], he saw his PCP and several tests
were done including Holter monitor, stress test, pulmonary
function tests and chest x-ray all of which reportedly were
normal.  A chronic dry cough developed over this time, and he
was started on PPI.  Cough improved some but stamina remained
low.  In [**11/2190**] continued complaint of cough prompted ENT
evaluation.
Laryngoscopy demonstrated changes consistent with PND and he was
started on a nasal spray, nasal wash and a course of
antibiotics.

In [**1-/2191**], progressive DOE and dry cough lead to pulmonary
specialist referral. Noncontrast CT scan demonstrated a 1.3 cm
nodule.  At this time, pt was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
further evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule.  Subsequent
contrast CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass arising within the
left pulmonary artery, vascular occlusion and expansion highly
suggestive of pulmonary artery sarcoma.  There was also
extravascular extension and bronchial artery transpleural
collaterals suggesting longstanding pulmonary artery
obstruction.  PET/CT scan later demonstrated a lobulated
low-attenuation FDG avid mass which occupies an experience of
left main pulmonary artery and extends beyond its wall.  There
was a new FDG avid left pleural effusion which developed over
the 7-day interval since the CT scan suggestive of tumor spread.
 On [**2191-2-24**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy of the
soft tissue mass, which revealed a spindle cell neoplasm with
necrosis, likely malignant.  By immunohistochemistry, the tumor
cells were diffusely positive
for vimentin, focally positive for cytokeratin cocktail, actin
and desmin; negative for S-100.  The profile was suggestive of a
smooth muscle phenotype.  Corresponding cytology was also
consistent with this diagnosis.

Patient presents now for operative resection.

PATHOLOGY:
PENDING

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname **] is a 66M with a recently diagnosed left pulmonary
artery sarcoma admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2191-3-23**] following: cervical mediastinoscopy, left exploratory
thoracoscopy, left thoracotomy and left pneumonectomy with
pulmonary artery reconstruction, cardiopulmonary bypass,
intercostal muscle flap buttress to the bronchial stump,
mediastinal lymph node dissection, bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage. Postoperatively, the patient was
transferred to the CVICU intubated, sedated, on pressors, foley,
Left chest tube and IV opoids for pain control.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient remained intubated and
sedated.  Sedation was weaned and patient was extubated on POD1.
 Upon extubation, patient received percocet and IV morphine with
good effect and adequate pain control.  Analgesia was eventually
adjusted to po oxycodone and tylenol RTC with improved effect.

Cardiac: Required pressors initially to maintain MAP > 60 ajd
was discontinued on [**2191-3-26**].  His SBP remained stable at
100-120. He remained in sinus rhythm without ectopy.  Low-dose
lopressor was started [**2191-3-27**] for tachycardia and increased to
25 mg tid on [**2191-3-29**] for HR 90-100.

Respiratory: Patient was successfully extubated on [**2191-3-24**].
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were initiated with oxygen
saturations of 95-98% on 1-2L NC.  On [**2191-3-29**] he titrated off
oxygen room with a saturation of 98% at rest and activity.
Serial CXRs were followed postoperatively to assess status of L
thorax and aeration of R lung.  L thorax demonstrated expected
fluid collection s/p pneumonectomy while R lung expanded well.

Chest tube: immediate postoperative output large amount of heme
which trended down.
The chest tube was removed [**2191-3-25**] and U stitch was placed to
seal chest tube tract.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids while
extubated. Upon extubation, patient's diet was advanced as
tolerated to regular/heart healthy and fluids were discontinued.
 He was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel
movement.  Urine output was monitored via foley catheter
postoperatively.  Lasix 20 iv x 1 dose given on [**3-25**] for
assistance w diuresis.  Foley was removed on [**3-28**] and patient
voided appropriately.  Intake and output were closely monitored.

Patient was noted to be hyponatremic to 129 on [**3-28**] prompting
free water restriction of 500cc/day.  Urine electrolytes were
also evaluated [**3-28**].  Electrolytes were followed [**Hospital1 **].

ID: Patient was given appropriate preoperative antibiotic
prophylaxis.  The patient's temperature was closely watched for
signs of infection.

Heme: Postop, serial HCT were done in setting of sanguinous
chest tube output.  He was transfused 7 units of PRBC to
maintain HCT > 24.  His last transfusion was [**2191-3-26**] with a
stable HCT of 29.  HCT remained stable throughout remainder of
admission.

Prophylaxis: Initially postoperatively, DVT prophylaxis was held
given concern for hemorrhage.  Subcutaneous heparin and ASA were
started on [**3-27**] when HCT stable.  Patient was also encouraged to
get up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge on [**2191-3-31**] the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.

History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with Stage IV small cell lung cancer with
involvement of the liver and a dermatomyositis paraneoplastic
syndrome, h/o PE in the setting of malignancy and IVIG
presenting s/p fall for rib pain.  10 days prior to admission,
he sustained a fall in his yard.  He states that even though
there was nothing noticable he tripped over, he did not have any
lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, presyncope, memory loss.
 The pain was [**2145-6-24**] and is getting progressively worse.  He had
pain on his right side which he attributed to broken ribs.  The

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2144-7-18**]: Presented with rash over forearms and torso.
[**2144-8-18**]: Later developed muscle weakness. Saw dermatologist, Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 16077**] - biopsy positive for dermatomyositis. Started on
prednisone 60 mg daily with good improvement of his rash and
weakness. He was also referred to a rheumatologist and
neurologist for further evaluation. Dysphagia symptoms also
apparent, evaluated by a speech and swallow therapist at [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2144-10-18**]: Radiographical workup - CT scanning showed a prominent
right hilar node and a lesion in the liver. Liver lesion by MRI
on [**2144-11-9**] at [**Hospital6 1109**] was equivocal.
[**2144-11-23**]: PETCT scan performed at [**Hospital1 **] showed abnormal
uptake in the right paratracheal lymph node, right hilum, liver
nodule in the mid portion of the right lobe, also a region of
the gallbladder.
[**2144-11-17**]: [**2144-11-26**]- an ultrasound guided liver biopsy was
performed at [**Hospital1 **]; lesion consistent with small cell lung
cancer. Staining shows positivity for synaptophysin, TTF-1, with
weak positivity for CK 7 and chromogranin (Pathologist Dr
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 83828**]). Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurology ordered anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]
and anti-striate muscle antibody which are positive, done on
[**2144-12-7**]. (Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] positive by immunofluorescence, but was not
positive by Western blot). A head MRI was performed on [**12-16**]
and showed no evidence of intracranial malignancy.
[**2144-12-18**]: Started chemotherapy
[**2145-3-18**]: Complete chemotherapy
[**2145-6-17**]: Dermatomyositis flare; subsequently given course of
steroids, IVIG, methotrexate. Interval CT scans do not show
obvious evidence of cancer progression.
[**2145-10-18**]: Pulmonary Embolism [**2145-11-7**], started on Lovenox
[**2145-11-17**]: hematochezia thought to be inflammatory colitis,
resolved with rectal steroids
[**2145-12-18**]: Dermatomyositis (DM) flare with fevers and ulcerative
lesions; CT on [**2146-1-7**] shows no progression of cancer
[**2146-2-15**]: Fevers, DM continue; lovenox implicated as one of
causes of fevers; fondiparinux substituted for lovenox. Hi dose
IV steroids used to control DM sx.
[**2146-3-18**]: Fevers abated with use of fondiparinux. PETCT suggests
inflammatory changes rather than overt SCLC recurrence.
[**2146-5-18**]: Recurrent disease seen mainly in liver on PETCT
[**2146-6-6**].

TREATMENT HISTORY:
FIRST LINE REGIMEN: carboplatin (5 AUC on day 1) and
etoposide(80mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) every 21 days per cycle.
-Started [**2144-12-21**] and completed 6 cycles. Last chemo given on
[**2145-4-9**].
SECOND LINE REGIMEN: carboplatin (5 AUC on day 1) and etoposide

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63 year old male with Stage IV small cell lung
cancer with involvement of the liver and a dermatomyositis
paraneoplastic syndrome, h/o PE in the setting of malignancy and
IVIG initially presented s/p fall for rib pain. Patient
subsequently had an MRI of the brain which showed a large
cerebellar lesion which is presumed to be metastasis from his
SCLC.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Cerebellar metastasis: Patient initially admitted to OMED for
rib fractures and pain management. He was noted to have
right-sided weakness so MRI was performed. MRI revealed new
cerebellar mass, likely metastasis from his SCLC. He
subsequently began vomiting. Neurosurgery was consulted and he
was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] ICU where follow-up head CT
showed no herniation, worse edema or hydrocephalus. He was
started on dexamethasone 6mg IV q4 hours and his symptoms
(including weakness) resolved, however he remains at high risk
for herniation. Rad-onc and neuro-onc were consulted and his
case was discussed at tumor board on [**6-19**]. On [**6-19**] he began
whole-brain radiation for a total of 10 sessions. He was
transferred back to the OMED service, where he continued to
receive radiation. Repeat CT head on [**6-28**] done to assess for
edema showed some improvement in mass effect and edema so his
dexamethasone was tapered to 4mg q6 hours. He completed his 10
session radiation course and tolerated it well aside from some
nausea. Patient's neurologic exam has remained stable with
slight dysmetria on finger-nose test. He is still a little
unsteady on his feet so he will receive PT at home with close
supervision by family. He is discharged on dexamethasone 4mg TID
with follow up with neuro oncology.

# Falls/Rib Fracture:  Likely due to mechanical fall versus
related imbalance from cerebellar lesion (see above). Pt was
started on narcotics for pain control. MRI brain showed
cerebellar met as above. He was continued on oxycontin with
oxycodone for pain control. He worked with PT, and they
recommend discharge on home PT with close observation at home by
family members.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Small Cell Lung Cancer: With metastases to liver, lung and now
brain (as above). Managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. To
follow-up with his primary oncologist as an outpatient.

# Dermatomyositis: On Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was continued on
atovaquone for ppx. Received IVIG in past, but stopped because
possible cause of his PE. Hx of treatment with methotrexate,
hydroxychloroquine. Was on prednisone prior to admission with
plans to decrease as tolerated, however this was stopped while
in hospital because he was started on dexamethasone with taper
as above. He will need to restart his prednisone after his
dexamethasone is discontinued.

# GERD: chronic, stable, continued H2 blocker in house.

# Depression: chronic, stable, cont Zoloft and Ativan PRN.

Chief Complaint:
need for possible esophageal and Y-stent placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Radiation therapy to lung mass


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87136**] is a 69 year-old man with COPD and newly diagnosed
right lower lobe poorly differentiated NSCLC w/ bulky
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and obstruction of the esophagus and
distal trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi. He was initially
transferred to the MICU from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital after being
admitted on [**2166-7-16**] for evaluation for esophageal and Y-stent
placement for compressive lung mass. VS on arrival were T 97.0,
BP 130/60, HR 110, RR 24 with sat 94 on 10LNC.

About two months ago, he presented with hemoptysis and, with the
workup, ultimatley had a biopsy around 3 weeks ago. He has lost
35 lbs due to anorexia and difficulty getting food down. He had
a PEG tube placed on [**2166-7-17**]. MRI head at OSH was negative for
mets. He was managed with duonebs, IV solumedrol and
azithromycin at the OSH, though his respiratory status continued
to decline.

In the MICU, he was started empirically on vanc/unasyn for
aspiration pneumonia and seen by IP. They felt that his hypoxia
was most likely secondary to right pulmonary artery compression
from the mediastinal mass/LAD, and did not feel that he would
benefit from Y-stent placement. However, if one were placed,
they recommended evaluation for simultaneous esophageal stent
placement. They also recommended chest CTA to rule out PE (he
previously had chest CT with contrast at OSH but was not
protocoled for PE per report), and urgent rad onc consult.

He is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] today for initiation of radiation
simulation and with first session of XRT to begin this
afternoon. Vitals immediately prior to transfer were 97.3 99-110

Chest CT [**7-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive mediastinal, hilar lymphadenopathy involving the
entire
mediastinum and hila bilaterally, with minimal change within the
right hilum compared to prior study. The lymphadenopathy encases
aorta, right main pulmonary artery and SVC as described in
details in the body of the report. Interval increase in
pericardial effusion is noted, small-to-moderate.
2. Right lower lobe mass, unchanged.
3. Bilateral pleural effusion, unchanged.
4. Large right adrenal mass, no comparison with prior studies is
available
and this area was not included on the prior outside study.
5. Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes most likely representing a
similar
process.
6. Hypodense pancreatic lesion, significance is unknown, might
represent IPMN or involvement of the pancreas by metastatic
process as well.
7. Status post PEG insertion due to significant compromise of
the esophagus by lymphadenopathy.
8. Metastasis involvement of L1 by lytic lesion with soft tissue
component.  No involvement of posterior endplate and spinal
canal is seen at this point.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o gentleman with RLL NSCLC and extensive mediastinal
lymphadenopathy that is compressing the esophagus, left lower
lobe segmental bronchi, and right pulmonary artery; he was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] while he completed his radiation course.
The patient did develop atrial fibrillation and rapid
ventricular rate that was controlled with Metoprolol.

PROBLEM LIST:
#. [**Name2 (NI) 87137**]/Hypoxia:  New diagnosis of lung cancer with involvement
of mediastinum and compression of right pulmonary artery, distal
trachea, bilateral mainstem bronchi, and esophagus.  Transferred
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for expedited XRT and monitoring during therapy.
Hypoxia likely multifactorial with right pulmonary artery
compression, ? of post-obstructive pneumonia, and airway
compression. Pt was given 5 days of XRT to fairly wide area in
chest. After few days started having difficulty with substernal
chest pain likely [**12-24**] to mass effect and post-radiation
changes/inflammation. He was also treated with a 7 day course of
vanc/unasyn for emperic coverage of post-obstructive pna. All
micro culture was negative. DNR/DNI status was established at
initial presentation. A palliative care consult was obtained due
to the nature of the disease process. Pain control recs were
left and followed and a discussion was started about long term
plans. Family expressed interest in having pt with son in [**Name (NI) 86**]
area with home hospice. Pt expressing interest in going home to
[**Location (un) 3844**]. Dr.[**Name (NI) 8949**] office called to schedule f/u
appointment in case pt stays in [**Location (un) 86**] area on D/C.

#. Pain, right chest, tumor-related: Fentanyl patch, as needed
morphine.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with new onset of Afib during the
evening of [**9-2**]. Also with RVR tachy to 150s. EKG showed no
signs ischemia. 5mg of IV metoprolol x 2 slowed rate to 110-120s
but not further and BP bottomed to 90s/60s. Metoprolol was
changed to QID. HR slowly increased again to 150s over next [**12-25**]
hrs but pt spontaneously convereted to sinus early in AM with no
further intervention. It is thought that a combination of atrial
compression from the mass and radiation change to the atrial
area precipitated the Afib which did not reoccur while in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Discharged on Metoprolol 50mg PO Q8hrs.  Recommend
increasing to 50mg PO Q6hrs if patient has recurrent rapid
ventricular response.

#. RUE swelling/erythema: noted on [**7-26**]. Concern for DVT or SVC
syndrome as come evidence of SVC compression on chest CT. U/S
RUE showed occlusive clot of cephalic vein (superficial vein)
but no DVT.

#. COPD:  Initially treated for COPD exacerbation at OSH with
azithro and solumedrol. Pt was kept on standing
ipratropium/albuterol + PRN albuterol for SOB but steroids were
discontinued per rad onc request while on XRT.

#. Back pain:  History of distant back surgery and patient
reports chronic back pain x decades, no worsening in last
several months. Rad Onc okayed NSAIDs during therapy so high
dose Ibuprofen was started in addition to standing opiods.

#. HTN: On metoprolol mostly for rate control.

#. DVT prophylaxis: Heparin subcutaneous

#. Code status: DNR/DNI

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room on [**2192-10-17**] where he underwent a right
thoracotomy and right upper lobe sleeve lobectomy.  He tolerated
the procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable condition.
 He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was controlled
with an epidural catheter. He underwent vigorous pulmonary
toilet including bronchodilator nebulizers and was gradually
able to wean off oxygen. His chest tubes had an intermittent
leak early on which resolved and there was minimal drainage.
His hematocrit was stable.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress.  His epidural catheter was removed on [**2192-10-19**]
and he had adequate pain relief with Oxycodone and scheduled
Tylenol.  He was able to use his incentive spirometer
effectively and was ambulating independently after his chest
tubes were removed. His xray showed a small apical space post
chest tube removal but he remained asymptomatic.  His incision
was dry and healing well and after an uneventful recovery he was
discharged to home on [**2192-10-22**] and will follow up in the Clinic
in 2 weeks.

CXR:
[**2113-2-5**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Lung volumes have minimally decreased. The pre-existing
massive
bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating at the right lung
base and the left lung apex are unchanged. Also unchanged is the
accompanying right basal pleural effusion. Traces of gas in the
right lateral soft tissues have completely resolved. There is no
evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
[**2113-2-1**]: There is a subsequent increase in severity of the
pre-existing massive parenchymal opacities, predominating at the
left lung
apex and the right lung base. No opacities have newly appeared.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Slightly
decreasing is the large right lateral chest wall air inclusion.

Chest CT: [**2113-1-30**]
1. Status post right lower lobe lobectomy and right upper lobe
posterior
segmentectomy.
2. Acute pulmonary embolism originating at the ligated right
lower lobe
pulmonary artery extending into the right middle lobe pulmonary
artery.
3. Diffuse bilateral honeycombing which is new since [**12-6**].
4. Right hydropneumothorax and pneumothorax.
5. Right-sided subcutaneous edema.

Echo: [**2113-1-31**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal inferior
septum, akinesis of the basal inferior free wall, and dyskinesis
of the basal posterior wall. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] was taken to the operating room on [**2113-1-26**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy and right
lower lobectomy with en bloc right upper lobe posterior
segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, and
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, for a right upper lobe
mass. The patient recovered in the PACU, extubated, on nasal
cannula, with IV fluid and PCA dilaudid for pain, along with
foley catheter and right chest tube to water seal with
intermittent leak. He was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 in stable
condition.

Neuro: The patient was initially on dilaudid PCA for pain which
was transitioned to oral tylenol, dilaudid, tizanidine. He
required IV medicine for breakthrough, including toradol on POD
3. On POD 4, tizandine was increased but stopped secondary to
hypotension and dilaudid changed to oxycodone with good control.
Over the course of his stay his pain medication was titrated and
he was discharged on oxycodone and acetaminophen.

Pulmonary: Serial chest xrays were done. The chest tube was
discontinued POD3. Aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers
and mucolytics along with lasix, were continued for lung
opacification which had appearance of infection vs.
inflammation. Despite optimum medical management on the floor
the patient became increasingly hypoxic and confused on
[**2113-1-30**]. He developed respiratory failure with oxygen
saturations of 70% 6L NC. A CTA revealed right middle lobe
pulmonary embolus. Heparin drip was started. He was transferred
to the ICU for further management and observation.  On 60%
Hi-flow FM  With aggressive pulmonary toilet,nebs, incentive
spirometer and good pain control he titrated off supplemental
oxygen with room air saturations of 92-94% with ambulation and
at rest.

Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia 100-120's and lopressor was
titrated.  On [**2-1**] he had brief episode of atrial fibrillation
150's with hypotension. Unresponsive to diltiazem and lopressor.

fluid
collections in the persistent right pleural space, despite
increase in
relative volume of fluid.
[**2196-5-2**]: Grossly stable to slightly larger right apical ptx,
s/p ct removal. increased right pleural effusion. Stable left
pleural effusion. Large subq emphysema. right pleural
thickening. post-op changes. no other change.
[**2196-5-1**]:  The right lower chest tube has been removed. The
upper chest tube is still in place. There continues to be a
moderate amount of right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.
Otherwise, no significant change in appearance of the lungs.
[**2196-4-27**]: Right chest tubes overlie right lung apex and right
lower lung, with extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right
chest wall and extending up right neck. Increased lucency of the
right lower lung may reflect compensatory hyperinflation of the
RLL rather than a basal pneumothorax. ET tube lies 7 cm from
carina. Gaseous distension of stomach.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5900**] was admitted following Right thoracotomy; right upper
lobe/right middle
lobe bilobectomy with chest wall resection of ribs 3 through 5
and pulmonary arterioplasty; mediastinal lymph node dissection;
intercostal muscle and pericardial fat pad buttresses; flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.  He was transferred to
the TSICU intubated and was extubated later that evening. He
transfered to the floor POD 1.

Respiratory: Extubated in POD1.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet,
nebs and incentive spirometer were administered.  He weaned from
the oxygen with room air oxygen saturations 93-97%.

Chest tube: posterior apical & basilar chest tube were to
suction initially and placed to water-seal with serosanguious
drainage. Airleak remained on suction POD 2, therefore
chest-tubes remained. On [**2196-5-1**] the postieror apical CT was
removed.
Residual small apical pneumothorax was seen.  On [**2196-5-2**] the
anterior apical chest tube was clamped.  Chest film revealed
stable right pneumothorax therefore the chest tube was removed.


Chest films: he was followed by serial chest films which showed
stable right apical pneumothorax, right lower lobe effusions.

Card: Immediately postoperatively he was hypotensive and
responded to a fluid challenge and minimal pressors.  On
[**2196-5-2**] he had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation 120's
which responded to 2.5 mg IV lopressor and 12.5 PO he converted
to SR 70.s  He remained hemodynamically stable with blood
pressures 100-120.

GI: Prophylaxis bowel regime & PPI were continued.  He was
placed on a strict bowel regime with good results, large BM
[**2196-5-2**].

Nutrition: On POD1 he was found to have a hoarse vocal quality.
Speech was consulted and recommended to continue baseline diet
of thin liquids and
regular solids as tolerated.  His electrolytes were repleted as
needed.

Renal: The patient was placed on flomax given history of urinary
retention.
Foley was removed he voided 50 cc with a residual of 600cc.  The
foley was replaced with plan of foley trials at rehab.  The
flomax was switched to Uroxatral 10 mg daily which he was taken
at home.

Heme: Intraoperatively he was transfused with 4 Units of PRBC,
postoperative he did well requiring no further transfusion with
a stable HCT of 26-30 range.

Incision: Right thoracotomy site clean, margins well
approximated, without erythema

Pain: Epidural Bupvacaine/Dilaudid was managed by the acute pain
service.  Once removed on POD  he was converted to PO pain
medications with good control.

Disposition: He was followed by physical therapy who
[**Hospital 5901**] rehab.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
an outpatient.

2. Intercostal muscle flap buttress.
3. Laparotomy and partial esophagectomy with
    esophagogastric anastomosis in the left chest.
4. Tube jejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16919**] is a 61-year-old woman with 1 year history of
recurrent URI-type symptoms.  Most recently in the past [**1-24**]
weeks
she has had cough, occasionally productive of yellow sputum. A
chest x-ray ordered by her PCP demonstrated [**Name Initial (PRE) **] suspicious
spiculated LLL lung nodule, and CT scan revealed a 5.2-cm
juxtahilar superior segment spiculated mass and left hilar lymph
node enlargement, as well as esophageal thickening consistent
with primary esophageal neoplasm.

Subsequently, she underwent PET scan which revealed a dominant
FDG-avid left hilar mass, SUVmax 13.6, centered in the superior
segment of the left lower lobe, compatible with bronchogenic
carcinoma, as well as low-level FDG-avid nodules at the base of
the left upper lobe and in the right lower lobe and FDG avidity
in and around the distal esophagus with a thickened wall.

Biopsy obtained on EUS revealed adenocarcinoma, positive
staining
of the tumor cells with CDX2, variable staining of the tumor
cells with cytokeratin 7 and few scattered tumor cells staining
with cytokeratin 20, with tumor cells nonreactive with TTF-1.
These finding support a gastrointestinal origin.

Biopsy obtained on EBUS revealed NSCLC, positive staining of the
tumor cells with cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, few scattered cells
show positive staining with p63, with tumor cells non-reactive
with CK20 and CDX2.  These findings support a pulmonary origin.

CXR:
[**2176-2-23**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-19**], the
chest tubes have been removed and there is no evidence of
pneumothorax. The opacification at the left base is somewhat
less prominent than on the previous images. The right lung is
essentially clear.
[**2176-2-19**]  There is residual left upper lobe atelectasis and
interval improvement in the right basilar atelectasis.
[**2176-2-18**] Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm reflecting left
lung resection is stable since [**2-15**]. Leftward mediastinal
shift has improved. There is a combination of atelectasis at the
base of the post-operative left lung and the gastric pull-up
which probably is responsible for most of the opacification at
the medial aspect of the left lower lung. Mild atelectasis in
the right lung is new. Upper lungs are clear. No pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette, normal post-operative appearance.
Left jugular line in standard placement. A drainage tube pull up
above the diaphragm. Left pleural tubes still present at the
base and upper midline left hemithorax.

Esophagus: [**2176-2-21**]  Status post esophagectomy with gastric
pull-through, without evidence of a leak.

Echo: TEE [**2176-2-14**] Surgeons performed egd prior to TEE to ensure
saftey of probe placement. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. The right ventricular free wall is mildly
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. RV function unchanged after lung
resection. TEE probe removed after lung resection prior to
esophageal surgery. EGD was perfomed after TEE. No complications
or injuries noted


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2176-2-14**] for Left thoracotomy and

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed, Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Push Enteroscopy ([**2193-10-18**])
Impression:
- Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus
- Clotted blood in the stomach body
- Erythema and congestion in antrum suggestive of mild gastritis

- 1.5cm cratered ulcer in duodenal bulb with visible vessel. 5cc
of 1:10,000 epinephrine, heater probe and one endoclip applied
with successful hemostasis.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small
cell lung cancer, ESRD on PD who is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for push enteroscopy after presenting to [**Hospital6 **]
with black stool, syncope, and hypotension.
.
He reports that on [**10-12**], he had his first episode of large dark
black loose bowel movement. He had had a normal brown BM the day
prior and denies any h/o BRBPR or GIB previously. He had no
abdominal pain nor nausea/vomiting prior to the event. Shortly
thereafter, he experienced LOC although the events surrounding
this are not entirely clear. He is not sure exactly what he was
doing and does not recall fall from what distance. He denies
hitting his head, but did scrape his right anterior calf. He
presented at that time to [**Hospital6 **] where he
underwent EGD which reportedly showed candidal esophagitis and a
nonbleeding duodenal ulcer. He received 2U prbcs and hct
stabilized thereafter. He was discharged home on [**10-14**] on
protonix and fluconazole and nystatin.
.
He is unsure if his BMs upon discharge revealed any blood or
black expect for he again noted a large black loose BM on [**10-16**].
He again had a syncopal event upon rising thereafter and
presented again to [**Hospital6 33**]. There he was found to
be tachy to low 100s with SBPs in the 70s-80s. He was reportedly
fluid resuscitated with crystalloid and received a total of 3
units prbcs with resolution of his tachycardia and improvement
in BPs. Repeat EGD demonstrated duodenitis but again no clear
evidence of active bleed. He was prepped for colonoscopy at
[**Hospital3 **] (clear output [**Name8 (MD) **] RN signout). He is now being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for push enteroscopy and colonoscopy. Hct
was 27 on presentation (was 34 on most recent discharge) and
prior to transfer was 28.7 after 3U prbcs.

Push enteroscopy
A single acute cratered 1.5cm ulcer was found in the first part
of the duodenum. A visible vessel suggested recent bleeding.


 5 cc.epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] was injected into the ulcer base and
heater probe applied for hemostasis with success to the ulcer in
the duodenal bulb.One endoclip was successfully applied to the
duodenal bulb ulcer for the purpose of hemostasis.

Impression: Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus
Clotted blood in the stomach body
Erythema and congestion in antrum suggestive of mild gastritis
1.5cm cratered ulcer in duodenal bulb with visible vessel. 5cc
of 1:10,000 epinephrine, heater probe and one endoclip applied
with successful hemostasis.

Recommendations:    Continue IV PPI drip
   Follow serial Hct,
   Continue NPO
   Check H. pylori serology and treat if positive



Brief Hospital Course:
76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung
cancer who presented to OSH with syncope and black stool x 2
without clear source of bleed on EGD at the OSH.

# Upper GI bleed from bleeding duodenal ulcer: Initial EGD at an
OSH showed a nonbleeding duodenal ulcer with repeat scope
showing duodenitis without evidence of ulceration. GI bleed
considered likely to be from small bowel AVM vs. ulceration
distal to segments scoped. Right sided colonic source was also
considered a possibility. Thus, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for push enteroscopy and colonoscopy for further work up. Push
enteroscopy revealed a 1.5cm cratered ulcer in duodenal bulb
with visible vessel. 5cc of 1:10,000 epinephrine, heater probe
and one endoclip applied with successful hemostasis. H/H has
been stable, along with sx. He was continued on IV protonix for
completion of 72h and then switched to po pantoprazole. His H.
pylori serologies were pending at time of discharge, but are now
negative. He will not need treatment. His hematocrit remained
stable. His diet was advanced to regular and he tolerated this
well.
.
# Anemia, Chronic anemia from chronic disease, and acute anemia
due to acute blood loss. Patient required 2 units of PRBC during
his [**Date range (1) **] admission and then an additional 3 units since
[**10-16**] (recieved at OSH prior to tx here). On admission, HCT=25.8
which increased to 30.4 after the endoscopy. This remained
stable for the duration of his hospital stay.
.
# Candidal esophagitis: Reportedly, the initial EGD at [**Hospital **] indicated candidal esophagitis, with initiation of
fluconazole and nystatin. Repeat EGD a few days later did not
state presence of candidal esophagitis. Enteroscopy performed at
[**Hospital1 18**] also did see this finding. Fluconazole and nystatin were
discontinued after 4 days of treatment. Patient has denied
dysphagia or odynophagia.
.
# ESRD on PD: Per records - seems pt with bx [**6-9**] - chronic AIN
with signs ATN - overall more consistant with possible FSGS -
Patient continues to recieve PD per home regimen here. Phosphate
was low on admission with daily increase to near normal levels.
He was continued on peritoneal dialysis.
.
# Lower extremity edema. He was given one dose of Lasix for his
lower extremity edema with some improvement in his symptoms, but
with rise in creatinine. He was given a prescription for Lasix
but should discuss use of this medication with his PCP and
nephrologist. This was communicated to the patient.
.
# Small cell lung cancer: Metastatic and not currently
undergoing any therapy. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58562**].  Plan to f/u as
outpt.
.
# BPH: Patient is oliguric, taking flomax, which was held
initially for concerns of hypotension. This medication was
restarted. His Foley was removed, and he voided without
problems.
.
# h/o DVT/PE/thrombocytopenia: s/p IVC filter. With history of
HIT and GI bleed, prophylaxis with pneumoboots.
.
He remained DNR/DNI throughout his hospital stay. He was
discharged to home with services.

pneumothorax present, decreased compared with [**2104-4-4**].
Otherwise, no
significant interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 93746**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a Left VATS converted to open
thoracotomy (See formal op note for details).  She tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition. Her
pain was initially controlled with an epidural catheter and she
maintained stable hemodynamics.

Following transfer to the Surgical Floor she continued to make
good progress.  Her oxygen was gradually weaned off and her room
air saturations were 96%.  She was able to use her incentive
spirometer effectively.  Following removal of her chest tube and
epidural catheter her pain was not controlled on oral
medications and she requires a Dilaudid PCA which was effective
along with some Toradol.  She was eventually placed on oral
Dilaudid and schedule Ultram and Tylenol and was then able to
get up and walk independently and continue use of the Incentive
spirometer. Constipation was a problem which was treated with
Dulcolax and Mirilax effectively.

Her blood sugars were initially in the mid 200 range post op but
decreased after her home Lantus and sliding scale coverage was
resumed.  She was tolerating a diabetic diet without difficulty.
 Her left thoracotomy incision was healing well. After a
relatively uneventful recovery she was discharged to home on
[**2104-4-8**] and will return to the Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2126-8-30**] to the thoracic surgery service
for a planned right thoracotomy, right lower lobe wedge
resection with decortication. She tolerated the procedure well,
was extubated and recovered in the PACU prior to being
transferred to the ICU in stable condition. For full details
please see the operative report. Three chest tubes were placed
during the procedure and a postoperative chest x-ray showed
expected right pneumothorax post surgery with three chest tubes
in place. Pathology revealed a 1.8 cm poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma with negative margins and no positive nodes. She
was started on a clear liquid diet, her pain was controlled with
an epidural and she was started on her home medications. On POD
1 her diet was advanced to regular and she was transferred to
the surgical floor from the ICU. On POD 2 she was noted to have
increased somnolence which was thought to be related to her pain
medications so her epidural was turned down and narcotics for
breakthrough pain were discontinued. She was given a unit of
PRBC for a Hct of 20.3 with an appropriate increase to 24.4 and
improved somnolence. On POD 3 metoprolol was started because of
elevated systolic blood pressures. She continued to have an air
leak from all three chest tubes. Her epidural was discontinued
and her foley catheter was removed. She was started on oxycodone
and tramadol for pain. By POD 4 the air leak had stopped in the
anterior chest tube so it was removed. The posterior chest tube
was removed on POD 6. On POD 7 she noted that she felt dizzy
when she was getting out of bed and was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR. She was given metoprolol once without
effect and was then given IV diltiazem once with return to sinus
rhythm. Cardiac enzymes were negative and she was monitored with
telemetry without recurrence. On POD 8 the air leak had resolved
in the basilar chest tube so it was removed. A post pull chest
xray showed no PTX. Because her pain was well controlled, she
was tolerating her diet and was ambulating without assistance,
she was discharged to home on POD 9 with instructions to follow
up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 5067**] clinic with a chest x-ray.

lingulectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 45989**] is a 74-year-old
woman who had undergone a workup for dyspnea prior to planned
knee replacement surgery. A CT scan noted that there was
growth of a left upper lobe lingular nodule. The patient also
had other pulmonary nodules and it was recommended that these
others be followed. Specifically, there was another nodule in
the left upper lobe which was in the upper division. I did
not think that this would come out with a  lingular
bisegmentectomy; however, in discussion with her
pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], he did not feel that a complete
upper lobectomy would be well tolerated, given her dyspnea at
baseline. This was despite her reasonable pulmonary function
tests. She could not complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test
due to her musculoskeletal problems, unfortunately.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year-old woman with a past medical history of
prior lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy, COPD, history of
breast cancer s/p radiation/lumpectomy, multiple recent
hospitalizations for pneumonia, initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-24**] with shortness of breath and persistent cough.
She had a recent admission at the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**] for a CAP,
COPD exacerbation during which she had a CTA of her chest which
showed a new lobulated right upper lobe mass invasive into the
airways, with possible postobstructive pneumonitis, highly
suspicious for malignancy. She was apparently supposed to have
an outpatient bronchoscopy, but this never happened. When she
presented to [**Hospital1 **] with SOB, she had a troponin of .28/.24,
diffuse deep TWI, BNP of 1,000. TTE was done which showed apical
hypokinesis, EF 60%. Cardiology was consulted and per notes,
thought she had stable CAD, not acute coronary syndrome,
recommended statin/aspirin, held off beta blocker secondary to
wheezing. In terms of her SOB, it was felt that she was having
another COPD exacerbation with possible postobstructive
pneumonia. She was initially admitted to the floor and improved
on PO steroids with nebulizers, then her respiratory status
worsened, she became tachcyardic and she was tranferred to the
MICU and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. According to the
notes, vanco had been dc'ed, however was given earlier today
prior to transfer. It was determined that she needed another CTA
of the chest, however, she declined. After speaking with IP
here, the patient was intuabted on [**6-30**], had a bronch at [**Hospital1 **],
and is being transferred post - procedure to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management and evaluation for possible stenting procedure. At
the time of transfer, the results of the bronch were unknown,
but tissue biopsies were taken.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedtaed,
comfortable on vent.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-30**] Chest Xray
Left lung is airless and mediastinum occupies the left
hemithorax suggesting prior left pneumonectomy.  Right upper
lobe is densely consolidated, and at its periphery is a 5 x 12
cm homogeneous opacity with lobulated margins along the lung
interface which certainly could be a mass involving lung and
pleura.  The right lower lung is free of consolidation but there
are septal lines suggesting mild edema.
ET tube is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the
upper stomach. Right jugular line tip projects over the middle
third of the leftward displaced SVC.

[**6-30**] ECG
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Right
bundle-branch block. Possible lateral infarction, age
undetermined. No previous tracing available for comparison.




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a history of non small
cell lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy and COPD who presented
with a new right lung mass and post - obstructive pneumonia. She
was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with symptoms of
shortness of breath. She was transferred for possible stenting.
She had been intubated at [**Hospital3 **]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics given concern for a
possible post-obstructive picture. She was seen by the
interventional pulmonary team shortly after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
They performed a bronchoscopy, but were unable to perform any
intervention given the location of the tumor compressing her
airway. Multiple discussions were held with the patient's family
and her outside providers were contact[**Name (NI) **]. We discussed her
overall poor prognosis. Ms. [**Known lastname **] family expressed that she
would not want any more invasive procedures or further
treatments. Her care was transitioned to comfort focused
measures. She was extubated on [**7-2**] and passed away on [**7-3**].

Her sons [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) **] were both contact[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) 6**] autopsy was

He therefore was treated to a definitive dose of radiation
therapy. However, he had persistent FDG avid disease in the lung
and after lengthy discussion, he was brought to the operating
room today for attempted pulmonary resection.  Before the
operation, we met on several occasions and discussed both the
conduct and risks of the operation.  He was well aware of the
risks including respiratory failure, pneumonia, inability to
completely resect the tumor, bronchopleural fistula and

Imaging:
[**2172-11-9**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. Peristent postoperative right middle lobe atelectasis. No
evidence of
right middle lobe torsion. The middle lobe bronchus is occluded,
but the
right middle lobe pulmonary artery and draining vein are intact.
The findings
thus most likely reflect mucus impaction.

2. Postoperative changes in the right hemithorax, including
nonhemorrhagic
layering pleural fluid, additional fluid interposed between the
superior
segments of the right lower lobe and the mediastinum, and a
small right apical
pneumothorax. The upper lobe bronchial stump is unremarkable.
Two chest
tubes, one anterior and one posterior, are in expected position.


3. Moderate emphysema.

[**2172-11-10**] CXR
There are two chest tubes seen on the right side with each one
ending near the right lung apex. The right mid lung opacity
representing an
unresolved collapsed right middle lobe is unchanged. There are
no new
opacities which are of concern. Endotracheal tube terminates
approximately
4.7 cm above the carina and is adequately placed. Gastric tube
is seen to
course through the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriate
in position.
Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Overall, no
interval relevant
changes.

[**2172-11-15**] CXR :
Overall appearance of the chest is stable with minimal residual
subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral soft tissues. A tiny
amount of residual air within the surgical bed at the right apex
in this patient status post right upper lobectomy. No focal
airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No
pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Slight nodularity of the
right lateral pleura particularly at the base is likely
postoperative in etiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2172-11-6**] after he underwent a thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient had an epidural with good
effect but with some hypotension and adequate pain control. When
tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral
pain medications.

CV: The patient was initially hypotensive to the SBPs 80s
immediately post-op and he was placed on neo up to 0.5mcg. He
was monitored in the PACU overnight and was stable to be
transferred to the floor on POD1. On the floor, his BPs have
remained stable off neo but he was placed again on the neo when
he was intubated and sedated in the SICU. Once transferred to
the floor again, he remained off all pressors. Vital signs were
routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was initially stable from a pulmonary
point of view post-op. His post-op CXR showed RML collapse but
aerated RLL. However, on POD 2 on the floor, the patient began
to desat to mid 80s on room air. A CXR was obtained and showed
RML as well as RLL collapse. He was transferred to the SICU on
[**2172-11-8**] to undergo a bronchoscopy with BAL, which was sent for
studies. For the bronch, he was intubated and sedated. He had a
repeat bronch on [**2172-11-9**] and [**2172-11-10**] AM and suctioned out more
mucous from his RLL and RML. He was stable from a pulmonary
standpoint thereafter and extubated on [**2172-11-10**] after CXR showed
good stable RLL. His CT was placed to waterseal on [**11-10**] and
removed on [**11-11**]. Post-pull CXR was stable. He was transferred to
the floor on [**11-12**] and his pulmonary status remained stable,
although with desat to the mid 80s on ambulation. He has not
been anle to wean off of oxygen but his requirements are
decreasing daily.  For that reason he will be sent home with
oxygen at 1-2 liters per minute and can gradually wean off over
time.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids. His
diet was advanced when appropriate once extubated in the SICU,
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen
to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on [**11-12**]. Intake
and output were closely monitored. His Cr was elevated to 1.6,
FeNa was 0.7%, showing a likely pre-renal etiology. He was
bolus'd w/ 500cc NS two times on [**11-13**] and [**11-15**].

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was not placed on any
antibiotics. However, upon transfer to the SICU, he was started
on vanc, zosyn, and tobra for empiric coverage of HAP. He was
switched to PO augmentin once tolerating PO and due to a rising
Cr.
Cultures only showed respiratory flora but a 10d course of
antibiotics was planned.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection. He had a temperature of 101.3 on [**11-14**] and fever
workup was sent but have so far been negative.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on [**2172-11-16**] , he was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. His incision was healing well.

Chief Complaint:
Dehydration, left recurrent chylothorax

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2198-5-30**] and [**2198-6-8**]: Ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis
(outpt)
[**2198-6-13**]: Left video-assisted thoracoscopy exploration and fibrin
glue application. Right video-assisted thoracoscopy thoracic
duct ligation and fibrin glue.
[**2198-6-22**]: Interventional Radiology - lymphangiography with
embolism of upper abdominal lymphatics up to the level of
cisterna chyli with microcoils and gelfoam slurry
[**2198-6-25**] Right pigtail placement for large pleural effusion
removed [**2198-6-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6955**] is a pleasant 76 year old female who underwent
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery left upper lobe wedge
resection and left lower lobectomy on [**2198-5-18**]. Pathology
revealed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma from the LUL wedge
resection (with 1 cm of free margin). The lower lobectomy
revealed a 6-cm poorly differentiated mixed acinar and solid
adenocarcinoma (with clean margins). Post-operatively, she
developed a slow-rate chylous effusion which was conservatively
monitored until chest tube removal on [**2198-5-23**]. She was
discharged on [**2198-5-24**].

Upon return to clinic it was noted that she had been doing well
on oxygen therapy, but her pre-visit CXR revealed evidence of
left pleural effusion recurrence. IP was consulted and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed an ultrasound-guided thoracentesis on [**2198-5-30**]. This
removed 1500 mL of chylous fluid (pleural triglycerides > 400).
On [**2198-6-5**] she again returned to clinic with recollection of
the chylous effusion and had a second thoracentesis performed.
It was felt, at that time, that duct ligation may be warranted,
but that her bronchial stump needed adequate healing time. IP
performed thoracentesis on [**2198-6-5**] removing 1800 mL of chylous
fluid.

She was seen in clinic on [**2198-6-12**] with dyspnea, cough symptoms
and dehydration and was admitted directly for surgical
intervention with thoracic duct ligation for her persistent
chylous leak. She had surgery on [**6-13**], but still with a chyle
leak.  On [**2198-6-22**], she underwent lymphangiography with
embolization of the leaking area as well as far distal and
proximal to the area.

Bedside swallow evaluation [**2198-6-28**]: no evidence of aspiration

CTA [**2198-6-25**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe pulmonary thrombus in the setting of lower
lobectomy.
2. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with right basilar
collapse.
3. 6.0 cm x 5.1-cm fluid collection within the left pleural
space compatible
with loculated hydropneumothorax. Continued followup to this
area is
recommended.
4. Diffuse intralobular septal thickening, findings suggestive
of volume
overload.
5. Scattered punctate areas of hyperintensity seen in both
hemithoraces,
likely related to previous embolization procedure.

CXR [**2198-6-28**]
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with
patient in
upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP
single view chest examination of [**2198-6-26**]. During the
interval, the right-sided pigtail ending pleural drainage tube
has been removed. No evidence of increased pleural effusion in
this area and no pneumothorax in the right apical area.

Diffuse left lower thorax density obliterating the diaphragmatic
contour
entirely remains rather unchanged. The same holds for evidence
of
contrast-dense linear structures, apparently remnants from a
thoracic duct
examination, remain in unchanged position. There is, however,
now evidence of a small 3 cm wide air-fluid level overlying the
left hilar area, a finding which was not present on the previous
portable examination. It is unclear whether this finding may
relate to changes in patient's position which is now upright. It
most likely represents a localized hydrothorax in this area
considering that the patient has recently undergone a left lower
lobectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6955**] was admitted to the Thoracic surgery service on
[**2198-6-12**] directly from clinic due to recurrent left sided
chylothorax, despite two thoracentesis and low fat diet. On
[**2198-6-13**] she underwent bilateral VATS with thoracic duct ligation
and fibrin glue. Her chylothorax persisted, therefore on [**2198-6-22**]
she underwent IR guided embolization of thoracic duct and upper
abdominal lymphatics, which was successful. Her left [**Doctor Last Name **] drain
revealed small serous output, therefore the drain was removed on
[**2198-6-25**]. CXR was stable. The patient however was short of breath
with hypoxemia on ABG. The patient underwent CTA of chest that
revealed increased right sided pleural effusion and thromus to
the [**MD Number(3) 25805**] that was previously resected. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25806**] was
not concerned about PE and anticoagulation with this finding;
but a normal variant given her LLL lung resection. The patient
was transfered to the ICU and underwent emergent pig tail
pleural catheter placement which initially drained 1200ml, then
300-400ml every 4 hours, with about 2L over the evening. The
patient had marked improvement in her pulmonary status,
breathing comfortable, oxygenating well on less oxygen, improved
mentation, and less anxiety. She was transferred back to the
floor where she recovered, tolerating a regular diet, ambulated
with PT and rested. Her chest tube was removed without right
pneumothorax on CXR on [**2198-6-28**].
A bedside swallow evaluation was performed which showed normal
swallow without evidence of aspiration. The patient however was
more comfortable with softer foods and crushed pills.

Of note she was afebrile but had leukocytosis to 28,800.
Initially she presented on [**2198-6-21**] with klebsiella UTI treated
with 5 day course of cipro which was found to be cured on repeat
urine culture. She had a PICC with TPN which was removed but all
cultures were negative to date. She did however on routine
culture test positive for MRSA in the nares.

The patient is ambulating with physical therapy, oxygenating
well on 2.5 Liter Nasal cannula, eating a low fat diet, with
stable electrolytes and vital signs. She is deemed safe for
discharge today to her former rehab as discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and the patient and her daughter [**Name (NI) 2270**]. She will
need nutritional optimization and continue vitamin supplements
as ordered. We will see her back in one weeks time for followup.

Right lung mass now overlaid with densities related to
mediastinoscopy.
No pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91129**] is a 69 year-old male admitted with right lung
cancer admitted for cervical mediastinoscopy.  He was extubated
in the OR transfer to the PACU.  Upon arrival he was found to by
hypoxic, with saturation to the 60's, was bagged and recovered
his sats to the 90's. At that point it was noticed that he
became non-verbal. He then became less responsive, and was
intubated for airway protection.  Neurology was consulted Head
and Neck CT was done (see above report). They felt this may a
result of PRES or vasospasm given the dramatic swings of BP
during and then after the procedure.  He transfer to the SICU
intubated.  Neuro exam at that time was non-focal. He was
successfully extubated, monitor closely overnight with no new
events. Neurology agreed with discharge home with no further
imaging studies.  Obtain D-dimer to assess hypercoagulability
given his cancer.  He tolerated a regular diet and was
discharged to home.  He will return on [**2187-11-13**] for his
scheduled outpatient Neck [**Date Range 4338**] and follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71yo gentlman who was admitted to the hospital
on [**7-29**] of this year for dyspnea, cough, and some low
volume hemoptysis.  He underwent an endoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3373**] on
[**7-31**].  No endobronchial disease was noted, but a radial
EBUS was performed from the superior segment of the left lower
lobe.  Bronchial washings were positive for adenocarcinoma and
the transbronchial biopsy showed atypical cells suspicious for
large cell carcinoma. He has undergone imaging that includes
both CT of the head on
[**2116-6-17**] that shows no metastatic disease.  CTA of the chest
shows a left perihilar mass that is 4.0 x 1.9 cm.  This mass is
centered in the left lower lobe, but does partially encase the
left lower lobe superior segment PA.  There are also two nodules
in the left upper lobe and a 0.9-cm nodule at the right apex.
PET scan performed on [**8-11**] shows the hilar mass to be FDG
avid
with an SUV of 17.  The left upper lobe nodule is non-FDG avid
as are other pulmonary nodules.  There was no metastatic disease
on this study. He subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy with
lymph node biopsy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7343**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-8-25**],
which was negative for malignancy. He now presents for surgical
resection of his lung mass.

CXR :In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is
little
interval change.  Substantial opacification of the left
hemithorax persists with the right lung being essentially clear.
 No appreciable pneumothorax.  Gas within soft tissues is seen
in the supraclavicular level on the left

[**2116-9-26**]
CXR :
There continues to be elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
left
effusion and an alveolar infiltrate in the left mid lung.
However, overall the aeration on the left is much improved.  The
right lung is clear.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**2116-9-18**], the patient underwent left
thoracotomy, left lower lobectomy,
arterioplasty of lower lobe pulmonary artery, mediastinal
lymphadenectomy, which went well without complication.  After a
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and an epidural
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received the epidural with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications. He was resumed on his
dementia medications and his narcotics were limited so as not to
promote more confusion.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient had an episode of desaturation into the
80's when chest physical therapy was being performed. He was
transferred to the ICU where bronchoscopy was performed and
secretions were evacuated. The secretions were sent for gram
stain and culture, which grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Otherwise, the patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Secretions from
bronchoscopy were sent for gram stain and culture. The patient
received vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage for
possible pneumonia. This regimen was scaled back to
ciprofloxacin once the culture sensitivities returned. He will
remain on Cipro thru [**2116-10-2**].

Endocrine: Patient was maintained on sliding scale insulin to
good effect. His blood sugars were monitored routinely.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Lung cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old male
presenting with left chest pain, who was found to have a left
Pancoast tumor.  Staging was with metastases.  He had
treatment with chemotherapy and radiation with the last round
of this being on [**2143-6-18**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (His past medical history is
significant for)
1.  Partial small-bowel obstruction on [**6-11**].
2.  Bladder cancer.
3.  Status post a neobladder operation in [**2139**].
4.  Heart failure with a negative stress test, most recently
in [**2143**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications on admission
included Ditropan, atenolol, and Zantac.

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He was an ex-smoker who quit five years ago.
He only engages in social alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   He had a review of systems that
significant for occasional blurry vision.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  His neck had no nodes.  His chest was clear to
auscultation.  His cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  His abdomen revealed no
masses, no organomegaly, with a midline laparotomy scar.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2143-7-23**], the patient was admitted
with a diagnosis of left superior sulcus lung cancer.  He
underwent a left upper lobectomy and chest wall resection of
ribs one through four performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] and assisted by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16059**].  He tolerated this well without any
complications.

Postoperatively, the patient was doing well.  He had two
chest tubes in place in the left pleural space and had an air
leak.  The patient did well until postoperative day one when
he developed a hypertension with rapid atrial fibrillation
requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control.  By
postoperative day two the drip was stopped, and the patient
was rate controlled with Lopressor.  He subsequently
converted back to normal sinus rhythm without any further
episodes.  Otherwise, the patient did well aside from a
persistent air leak that did not resolve until postoperative
day five when the patient was placed on water seal, and by
postoperative day six the air leak was no longer present.
The chest tubes were then removed without complication.

Of note, the patient did develop a right antecubital
superficial thrombophlebitis which was treated with hot
packs, elevation, and Keflex for a 7-day course.

The patient did well otherwise, and was seen by Physical
Therapy who felt that he would benefit from outpatient
strengthening and range of motion exercises for the left arm.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition, clear to auscultation, a regular rate and rhythm.
His wounds were clean, dry and intact.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:   (He was discharged on)
1.  Senokot one to two tablets p.o. p.r.n.
2.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. times three days
4.  Ditropan 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
7.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  He was discharged with outpatient
physical therapy.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He was instructed to follow up with
Dr.[**Name (NI) 14732**] office in two days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Episode of atrial fibrillation.
2.  History of congestive heart failure.
3.  History of bladder stage IV.












4.  History of small-bowel obstruction.
5.  Left Pancoast tumor, status post resection.

CXR:
[**2194-8-24**]: There is slight interval increase in the loculated air
collection within the right apex. Otherwise, no significant
change since the prior radiograph is demonstrated.
[**2194-8-23**]: There is evidence of a right apical air collection
within the right apical fluid consistent with localized
pneumothorax. Another area of localized pneumothorax is seen in
the right mid lung base. There is interval progression of right
lower lobe consolidation, worrisome for progression of
infectious process.
[**2194-8-21**]: Right chest tubes remain in place and there is a
continued apical pleural capping. Some mild basal pneumothorax
is again seen on this side. Bilateral atelectatic changes are
seen at the bases. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia

correct position. Minimal basal pneumothorax. Minimal air
inclusions in the soft tissues. Overall, the lung volumes have
decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally
increased. There is no pulmonary edema and no evidence of focal
parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Chest CT: [**2194-8-22**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Thrombus at the surgical
stump of the
right lower lobe pulmonary artery, an expected finding.

thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy for stage IIIA non-small
cell lung cancer. She was extubated in the operating room,
monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the floor. On POD2 she
developed respiratory distress and required tranfer to the SICU.
 A chest CT was negative for pulmonary embolism.  With diuresis,
aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs she improved.  She transfer
back to the floor in stable condition.

Respiratory: With aggressive pulmonary toilet, schedule nebs,
incentive spirometer and ambulation she titrated her oxygen
requirement to 4L nasal cannula with oxygen saturations of 94%.

with worsening lower and upper extremity weakness. Pt also seen
by ENT last Friday and found to have known bilateral vocal
paralyiss by now an opening of only 2 mm. Pt does report
increased sob over the past few days.
Pt was admitted ealier this month because of worsening upper and
lower extremity weakness. He had an MRI the C/T/L spine, a
dedicated MRI of the cervical spine and a MRI of the brain.
These images showed likely progression/worsening edema of known
intramedullary disease of the cervical spine, regression of
lumber spinal disease and brain mets. Pt evaluated by both
radiation oncology and neurosurgery. At that time neurosurgery
thought that no surgical intervention would be of benefit. As pt
has received xrt to teh whole spine , no additional radiation tx
was recommended either.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo man with extensive SCLC status post four cycles of
cisplatin and
etoposide followed by radiation in the residual intrathoracic
disease, brain and spine radiation most recently has clinically
progressed on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] irinotecan with progressive
quadriplegia and vocal cord paralysis.

Pt seen by ENT on day of admission and found with only 1 mm of
airway. ENT recommended an elective intubation followed a
tracheostomy. This option as well as a palliative approach in
which we would manage his symptoms and not prolong his
sufferings was discussed with pt. Pt understands that he has end
stage cancer with progressing quadriplegia, without any good
therapeutic options.The procedure of intubation was also
explained to patient.
The patient together with his wife, decided that he wished to
pursue with elective intubation and afterwards decide if to
undergo a tracheostomy or to choose palliative care without a
tracheostomy.  While intubated in the ICU, he was noted to have
hypotension and was on dopamine via peripheral IV.  This was
discontinued as IV infiltrated, raising concern for ischemia.
Pt was seen by hand service who recommended hand elevation and
discontinuing dopamine. Pulses remained intact, good cap refill.
Given the progressive quadriplegia and his worsening disease, it
was decided by the family that he would not want the
tracheostomy after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], outpatient
oncologist, as well as with the primary ICU team.  He was
transitioned to a focus on comfort measures.  Patient expired at
8:55 PM on [**2181-5-20**], autopsy was offered and declined.

CXR:
[**2113-3-24**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-22**], there
is little change.  Again there is a long air-fluid level in the
left hemithorax at the level of the hilum. The right pleural
effusion has decreased.
[**2121-3-22**]  The fluid level in the left hemithorax has again
slightly
increased. No other changes in the left hemithorax. The right
hemithorax has also unchanged appearance, including a minimal
right basal pleural effusion.
[**2121-3-19**]: Interval increase in amount fluid in the
left pleural cavity. Expected elevated left hemidiaphragm. There
is interval decrease of amount of subcutaneous gas in left chest
wall. Unchanged appearance of right small pleural effusion.
Right lung is clear.
[**2121-3-18**]: Status post left-sided pneumonectomy. Only minimal
left-sided
mediastinal shift.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 81697**] was admitted on [**2121-3-18**] for Flexible
bronchoscopy with therapeutic
aspiration, left intrapericardial pneumonectomy and a
mediastinal lymphadenectomy.  She was extubated in the operating
and transferred to the SICU for further management.  The NGT was
to low-wall suction, left Penrose drain in place. Her pain was
managed by the acute pain service with via Bupivacaine &
Dilaudid epidural with good control.  On POD1 she transferred to
the floor, the penrose drain and NGT tube were removed.  She was
scoped by ENT for hoarness which showed a paretic left vocal
cord with minimal glottic gap. On POD2 she had a video swallow
which showed no aspiration.  She was started on a regular diet
which she tolerated and her home medications. On POD3 the
epidural was removed and her pain was well controlled with PO
pain meds.  The foley was removed and she voided. She was
maintained on a 1.0-1.5L
liter restriction.  Her electrolytes were monitored and repleted
as needed.  She was followed by serial chest films.  She was
re-scoped by ENT on POD5 which showed no change.  They
recommended no treatment at this time. She was seen by physical
therapy. On POD6 she continued to do well and was discharged to
the Holiday Inn with her husband and son. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week.

History of Present Illness:
42 y/o F PMH Breast Cancer metastatic to lungs, cranium, spine
(epidural T1/T4, cervical/upper thoracic spine) and bone (spine
and sternum) and leptomeniges. According to recent Oncology
notes current treatment is Doxorubicin (last treatment
[**2141-12-26**]), steroids and s/p XRT for leptomenigeal disease.
Patient currently intubated consequently history from OMR and
family.
.
Patient presented to ED T 95.3, BP 129/95, HR 98, O2 Sat 100% (?
oxygen) and triggered for respiratory distress. She was placed
on NRB with O2 Sat 93%. Respiratory status worsened despite
inhalers and patient became increasing somnelent and
consequently was intubated. Patient was given levaquin for
concern of PNA.
.
Per family patient had 1 week history of SOB with exertion.
Breathing increasingly laboured over the past week at rest.
Family reports several months of SOB but with exertion only.
Denies associated fever, chills, cough, hemopytsis. Daughter has
cold, but not severe and requires no antibiotics. No chest pain.
Does report bloody nose last night and usually every other week.
Mother reports patient more disoriented this afternoon and
easily tired. Family not aware of lung metastasis.
.
Of note patient's most recent admission [**2141-10-17**] for headaches
started on steroids/radiation therapy, dyspnea ruled out for PE
felt to be secondary to metastasis. Recent Heme Onc notes
notable for agitation/hallucinations felt to be related to
steroids.

Select Reports:
-CTA: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Progression of metastatic
disease involving mediastinal and right hilar nodes. True extent
of malignancy likely underestimated by low lung volumes and
bibasilar consolidations, due to combination of aspiration and
pneumonia. 3. Given septal thickening at least in part due to
pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of carcinomatosis would be
difficult to exclude. 4. Left breast nodule, though
subcentimeter, is larger than in [**2141-8-30**].
.
-TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2140-9-29**], probably no major change.
.
-CT Head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and configuration. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
well preserved. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear and well aerated. Re-demonstrated is diffuse metastastic
involvement of the calvarium and skull base.
.
-CXR on day of discharge [**2142-1-3**]: In comparison with the study of
[**1-2**], there is increasing diffuse bilateral pulmonary
opacifications. In view of the enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette and blunting costophrenic angles, this could well
represent pulmonary edema. However, the possibility of
supervening pneumonia or even ARDS would have to be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 42 year old female PMH metastatic breast cancer (lung,
spine and leptomeningeal) who presents with respiratory distress
of 1 week duration requiring intubation on arrival to ED. No
specific cause was found for her deterioration whcich was put
down to disease progression following an unchanged TTE, negative
CT-PA for PE, no evidence radiologically for DVTs and no culture
data to suggest an infectious precipitant.
.
.
# Respiratory Distress: Thsi was considered likely due to
progression of knoen metastatic breast cancer. Her primary
oncologist felt that she should not be intubated again. Mrs
[**Known lastname 98114**] was celebrating birthday with family, unable to blow
candles out. She then noted increasing sob, family called EMS.
On NRB at presentation to the EW, sO2 91%. A&O at that time and
stated she would like to be intubated, if needed. She then ecame
tachypneic and lethargic and was intubated and commenced on
propofol. She was transferred to the MICU for further care CXR
showed no evidence of pneumonia. Sputum revealed respiratory
commensal flora. Given progressive shortness of breath without
symptoms of cough/fever concerning for PE especially in setting
of known metastatic disease. She therefore had a CT-[**MD Number(3) 24709**]
showed no evidence of PE but did show progression of metastatic
disease involving mediastinal and right hilar nodes. In
addition, teh report noted that given septal thickening at least
in part due to pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of
carcinomatosis was considered difficult to exclude. The Left
breast nodule, was larger than in [**2141-8-30**]. LENIs were done and
were negative for DVTs. Given possible pulmonary edema, she had
a TTE which showed no significant change from prior. She had
furosemide IV prior to extubation given above BNP 411 and she
had a good diuresis to this. She was treated Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin and thsi was stopped post extubation. She was
successfully extubated on the evening of [**1-2**] and passed a SBT.
She was saturating well on room air and transferred to teh
oncology service and was discharged on [**1-3**].
.
# Altered Mental Status: This was initially presnet at time of
hospital admission and peri-intubation and resolved [**1-2**] post
intubation. She had a CT-head which showed no acute process. She
was at her baseline after this.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Slowly trending down from [**2141-11-10**]. Last
platelet count [**2141-12-28**] 23. Most likely chemotherapy side effect
- received Doxorubicin [**2141-12-26**] - espeically in setting of diff
with metas/myelos/nRBC. This was felt unlikely DIC as PT/PTT
within normal limits, no schistocytes, fibrinogen elevated. This
was trended and trended remaining around 15. There was no sign
of active bleeding.

# Hyponatremia: This was initially felt most likely hypovolemic
or SIADH. Urine Na 49 and urine osmo 441 suggested SIADH. She
has several possible causes for SIADH including metastatic
disease, possible pneumonia or CNS involvement. This was trended
and improved to 140 on discharge.
.
# Anemia: Above baseline 26-29. This was trended.
.
# Transaminitis: Slightly elevated from prior however labs
hemolyzed. Prior CT A/P showed no metastatic disease within the
abdomen and pelvis. This was trended and decreased by teh time
of discharge. No further work-up was performed.
.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Overall poor prognosis due to
metastasis to lung and bone. MR head [**2141-12-20**] near total
resolution of the previously noted pachymeningeal and
leptomeningeal disease compared to [**2141-9-29**] s/p XRT. Per ED,
patient wished to be intubated and also discuss with mother. O/P
oncologist felt that patient should not be intubated in future.
We started dexamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **].  - Confirm whether patient
currently taking Dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She was extubated on
[**1-2**] and was saturating well on room air. Post extubation, we
restarted her outpatient pain regimen of Fentanyl and Oxycodone.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: WE held Alprazolam while on midazolamd
infusion adn post extubation on [**1-2**] we restarted he home regime
of alprazolam, Setraline and Perphenazine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname 98114**],

You were recently admitted for management of shortness of
breath. You were initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) where you had a machine helping you breathe. They provided
you with antibiotics and medications to remove excess fluid and
you improved. You were transferred to the floor. We are
providing you with a prescription for an antibiotic to continue
after discharge.
.
Your platelets were discovered to be very low during this
admission. You will need to return for a follow up appointment
tomorrow morning at 9 AM (detail below). You will need to have
your platelets re-checked. Please be very careful that you do
not fall, as injurying yourself could be very dangerous because
with low platelets your blood does not clot appropriately.

History of Present Illness:
47F with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) stage IIIA s/p chemotherapy, XRT complicated by
development of transesophageal fistula. Patient is s/p
esophageal
stent and PEG tube placement in 11/[**2181**]. Patient had multiple
admission for aspiration pneumonia with prior culture growing
pseudomonas. Patient was on a course of Levofloxacin and flagyl.
Patient was admitted most recently to OSH with increasing SOB,
fever during antibiotic course.  CXR on admission showed
bilateral pleural effusion and consolidation at right lung base.
Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed
aspiration pneumonia then switch to Ceftazidime and flagyl when
sputum grew out pseudomonas resistant to Levofloxacin.  Due to
suspicion of stent leak causing pneumonia, a barium swallow was
ordered.  The swallow study showed tracheoesophageal fistula
with
leakage of barium into left bronchus. CT chest showed
pericardial
effusion, collapsed right lower lobe, consolidation right lower
lobe, and bilateral pleural effusions. Empyema was suspected and
IR placed a pigtail and drained pleural fluid which was negative
for organisms and malignant cells.  Pigtail was removed prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Bronchoscopy was performed due to concern of
reoccurance and found mass in bilateral main bronchus.  After
discussion with oncology and gastroenterology a bronchial stent
placement was recommended to prevent further aspiration and
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for placement of stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
47F lung ca c/b transesophageal s/p esophageal stent w/
persistent leak and aspiration pneumonia was admitted on [**2-12**].
She was placed on antibiotics, made NPO and taken to the OR for
Rigid bronchoscopy was performe on [**2-13**] and found complete
destruction of bronchus intermedius.  On [**2-14**] patient was sent
for EGD to remove the esophageal stent.  The esophageal stent
was removed without complications. Then an attempt was made to
place a bronchial stent. The tracheoesophageal fistula was found
to involve right main stem and bronchus intermedius and was
deeemed unable to stent or repair.  At that point the procedure
was aborted and patient was sent to PACU.  She was extubated
successfully in PACU then sent to SICU for further recovery.
Family and patient was approached and told the prognosis of the
patient's condition.  After discussion with family and patient
hospice care was decided  Patient was made DNR/DNI.  Patient
will be transferred to [**State 531**] for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating
Room where he underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy and left VATS
with a left upper lobe sleeve resection (see Operative Report
for complete details). He tolerated the procedure well and was
brought to the SICU in stable condition.  He maintained stable
hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled with an epidural
catheter.  He was kept in the ICU overnight to optimize his care
and to monitor his respiratory status.  Good pulmonary toilet,
aggressive incentive spirometry, and nebulizers were used to
optimize respiratory function.  He was transferred to floor on
POD 1 requiring only 02 via nasal canula.

Neuro: The patient received an epidural and IV tylenol
immediately post-op with good effect and adequate pain control.
APS service retained epidural until POD 4 due to efficacy.  He
was subsequently transitioned to oxycodone as well as PO
tylenol.

CV: Metoprolol was use post-op for rate prophylaxis against
A-fib due to possible pericardial irritation intraoperatively.
Patient's rate well was controlled throughout his stay with out
issue and remained in sinus rhythm.  Patient will not be
discharged with home beta blockade.

Pulmonary: Good pulmonary toilet, nebulizers, incentive
spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged throughout his
stay.  Patient was quickly weaned to nasal canula and
subsequently room air.  Nebulizers were continued for persistent
wheezing noted on auscultation which had nearly completed
resolved by discharge.  Chest tube was kept to water seal and
initially had high output and was retained until POD 4 and was
discontinued without complication.  Routine CXR revealed
continued left sided atelectasis and flexible bronchoscopy was
performed by interventional pulmonology on POD 5 which revealed
granulation tissue along the anastomotic site.  Repeat CXR
showed continued atelectasis and questionable pleural effusion
and IP again saw the patient and performed ultrasonography which
revealed a small amount of fluid not amenable to drainage.
Patient was asymptomatic by discharge without shortness of
breath or respiratory distress and was ambulating without
difficulty on room air.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was started on sips and
advanced as tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when
necessary.

ID: Intraoperative cultures revealed gram negative rods on gram
stain and patient was begun on Unasyn.  Postoperatively he had a
leukocytosis to 28K which was downtrending throughout his stay.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely
watched and were downtrending throughout his stay and afebrile
at time of discharge.  Bacteria was speciated as H. flu that was
beta lactamase negative and presumptively  sensitive to
amoxicillin and patient was discontinued on a course of
augmentin.  Incisions were routinely monitoring and were without
signs or symptoms of infection.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received famotidine while in the ICU
and subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during
this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 8814**] was taken to the operating room on [**2116-3-4**] by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] for a right thoracoscopy converted to right thoracotomy,
right upper lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, for a
concerning right upper lobe nodule. She came out of the OR with
a right chest, foley and IV dilaudid for pain.  On [**2116-3-5**] she
was successfully extubated.  The patient transfered to the floor
on [**2116-3-6**]. Below is a systems review of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course:

Neuro/Pain: The acute pain service was consulted postoperatively
and placed a Paravertebral catheter with Bupivacaine 0.25%
infusing and Dilaudid PCA.  This was dc'd [**2116-3-8**]. The patient
was placed on morphine IR, with good effect.

Respiratory: Aggressive pulmonary toilet was encouraged.
Nebulizers continued. Secretions were not an issue. The
patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 87% while ambulating
therefore she was sent home on 2L NC oxygen. The patient's
resting oxygen saturations were >92%. The right chest tube from
surgery did not have a leak and was dc'd [**2116-3-6**] with stable
postpull right apical pneumothorax.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable without
arrythmia. She was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid for both
EF 40% (echo done on ICU admission at bedside to evaluate true
cardiac function), and to prevent atrial fibrillation as the
patient was tachycardic (Initiating beta blockade discussed with
Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt outpt cardiologist). The patient's I and O,
and daily weights were watched. She was given lasix [**2116-3-6**]. Her
dc weight was 100kg. There were no issues with heart failure.

Abd: Diet was advanced and tolerated on dc. Stool softeners
given to prevent constipation while on narcotics.

Renal: Foley was dc'd [**2116-3-6**] with good urine output following
such. Electrolytes were followed and replaced as necessary.

ID: CBC and fever curves were watched, without infectious issues
during this stay.

Lines: A right AC peripheral IV was continued on the floor and
dc'd prior to discharge. There was a small area of erythema
surrounding this site. It was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on date of
discharge, and pt told to take ibuprofen with arm elevation and
warm compresses. No antibiotics were needed at this time.

Proph: DVT proph: SCD's and heparin SQ. Ulcer proph: PPI.

PATHOLOGY: PENDING


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2193-4-10**] and had an open left lower lobectomy, partial
bronchoplasty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
admitted to the SICU postoperatively secondary to patient's
multiple medical comorbidities.  He was admitted to the SICU
with an epidural, L chest tube to suction and a foley catheter.

Neuro: Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural catheter
placed.  Post-operatively, the epidural functioned well with
adequate pain control. On POD2, patient had episode of
agitation/combativeness during which he self-d/c'd his epidural.
 This episode required restraints and IM haldol following which
patient was coherent and cooperative throughout remainder of
admission.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.  Patient refused po
narcotics and reported adequate pain control with tylenol.

CV: Preoperatively, plavix was held but ASA continued.  On POD1
patient had new onset afib refractory to IV lopressor 5mg x 4
doses.  Amiodarone bolus and gtt were initiated after which
patient converted to NSR.  Amiodarone was transitioned to po and
metoprolol dose was changed to 100 [**Hospital1 **].  Patient instructed to
discontinue metoprolol succinate at home in favor of metoprolol
tartrate 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  At time of discharge patient is in NSR.
Plavix restarted POD2.  Vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: Patient had left chest tube placed at time of
surgery.  Tube was placed to suction postop.  Changed to water
seal 4am on POD1 and subsequently removed later that day.  Post
pull CXR demonstrated no PTX.  Pulmonary toilet including
incentive spirometry and early ambulation were encouraged.  On
day of discharge, patient with SaO2 96%RA at rest and 90-92 with
deep breathing on ambulation.  Vital signs were routinely
monitored.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake.  His diet was advanced from clears to
renal regular diet on POD0. He was also started on a bowel
regimen to encourage bowel movement. Patient on hemodialysis and
oliguric at baseline.  Renal followed throughout admission.
Foley was removed on POD#1. Patient was taken for hemodialysis
on POD1 and POD3 which he tolerated well.  Intake and output
were closely monitored.

ID: Patient was given preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with
ancef. The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs
of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD#4, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a renal regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74901**] is a 63 year old male with a history of poorly
differentiated non-small cell lung cancer with known metastases
to brain and liver, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], and RUE DVT on lovenox
who presents with worsening dyspnea.
.
He was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer in
[**2153-10-11**] and has received cyberknife for brain lesions,
carboplatin, pemetrexed, and PF-[**Telephone/Fax (3) 74902**] as part of a
clinical trial.  He discontinued this trial [**Doctor Last Name 360**] on [**2155-8-6**]
because of clinical (worsening dyspena) and radiolographic
evidence of cancer progression.   He then started a new [**Doctor Last Name 360**],
Alimta, on [**2155-8-7**].
.
His recent history is notable for dsypnea over the last four
weeks that has worsened over the past four days.  He underwent
right thoracentesis on [**2155-8-1**] with removal of 800cc of cloudy
yellow fluid found to be a malignant effusion.  He had some
improvement in his dyspnea as a response but notes worsening
over the past few days, even after starting home O2 (2-4L) on
[**2155-8-7**].  He also notes having subjective fevers and chills and
a nonproductive cough since starting Alimta.  He presented to
the ED because of worsening symptoms.
.
VS on presentation were 97.9 128/60 97 28 94%ra.  He had a CXR
and a chest CTA that was neg for PE but concerning for worsened
pleural effusions bilaterally, lymphangetic spread of tumor, and
a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was given vanc/zosyn
and bronchodilators.  He became increasingly dyspneic and
hypoxic in the ED, satting 87% on ra, and was placed on a NRB
(satting in the 90s and then bipap with significant improvement.
 He was then admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival, he is with his family and appears comfortable on
bipap.  He has no complaints.
.

IMAGING:
.
CTA [**2155-8-10**]:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
slightly increased in size since the prior study.
3. Increase in encasement of the right-sided airways by soft
tissue density, likely representing tumor, with areas of
increased consolidation in the inferior aspect of the right
upper lobe and right middle lobe likely due to post-obstructive
pneumonia, although increased tumor burden cannot be excluded.
4. Diffuse bronchovascular and septal thickening consistent with
lymphangitic spread of tumor.
5. Stable left lower lobe lung mass.
6. Stable diffuse bony metastases and hepatic metastases.
.
ECHO [**2155-8-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2155-8-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable radiographic examination with
slight
accentuation of the interstitial markings most notably on the
right. There is suspected mild volume overload on the background
of lymphangitic
carcinomatosis. At least partially loculated left pleural
effusion again
re-demonstrated.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
admitted with dyspnea 1 week following right sided thoracentesis
for pleural effusion, found to have reaccumulated pleural
effusion on x-ray.
.
Hypoxia: The pt was initially on non-rebreather in the ED, and
was weaned to BiPap in the ICU. On [**8-12**] am the pt was noted to be
stable on 4L nasal cannula oxygen, and he did not have to go on
bipap again. Dyspnea was most likely due to fluid reaccumulation
and progression of cancer, however vanc/zosyn was started for a
7 day course for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. On [**8-12**] pt
had a right thoracentesis with 1200 ml serous fluid removed. On
[**8-13**] pt had a left thoracentesis with 500 ml removed. Pt will
likely need pleurex catheter on the right if fluid reaccumulates
again. Pt tolerated both procedures well, and was transfered to
OMED on [**8-13**] with interventional pulmonary planning to follow him
on the floor. On the floor, patient looked well and was satting
in the mid 90s at 4LNC. He felt well and was ready to go home.
It was thought that even though he was above his baseline for
O2, that because his prognosis was only weeks remaining that it
would be best for him to go home to be with his family for his
remaining days. He was to follow up with IP within 1 week for
evaluation for pleurodesis and to see his oncologist on [**2155-8-28**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Left upper lobe mass with history of Stage IV NSCLC for
pericardial involvement three years ago.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-7-24**]:
OPERATIONS:
1. Left thoracotomy/left pneumonectomy.
2. Buttressing of bronchial stump with intercostal muscle.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a large left upper lobe
tumor.  He presented in [**2144**] with a malignant pericardial
effusion and received palliative
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Surprisingly, he has done
well for 3 years and has no evidence of disease outside of the
left upper lobe.  Given this and his good performance status and
pulmonary function, we brought him to the operating room today
for possible resection.

Past Medical History:
Stage 4 Non-small cell lung cancer (due to pericardial
involvement), CVA in
[**2140**] with left sided weakness, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM II


Social History:
He is married and has no children.  He
previously worked in construction before his diagnosis.  He is
originally from [**Country 6257**].  He
previously smoked 1-2 packs per day x 42 years, quitting in
[**2144**].
He drinks 3 bottles of wine per week.

[**2147-7-31**] Discharge CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-30**], there is no
change in the
postoperative appearance with a large air-fluid level and
substantial filling of the left hemithorax with fluid. Elevation
of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour and shift of the trachea
to the left are again seen. The right lung is essentially clear.


[**2147-7-28**] KUB:
IMPRESSION:

1. Increased gaseous distension of the colon, consistent with
post-operative ileus.

2. Distention of the stomach with air and fluid should be
correlated
clinically, as this patient may benefit from placement of an NG
tube.

[**2147-7-26**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy small/normal cavity size and preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Dilated aortic sinus.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-1-28**],
then findings are similar (prior study image quality was
superior).

[**2147-7-25**] Renal US:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of tardus parvus waveforms bilaterally
in the right or the left kidney. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Exam limited due to the patient's body habitus.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32665**] was brought into the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2147-7-24**] where he underwent left thoracotomy/left pneumonectomy,
and buttressing of the bronchial stump with intercostal muscle.
He recovered in the ICU postop with left chest tube to water
seal. He was hypotensive requiring multiple albumin boluses and
IV fluids, along with neosynephrine POD 1.

POD 1 he developed acute kidney injury. Renal consult was
obtained and he was felt to be prerenal. Renal US was a poor
study due to body habitus but did not show abnormality. His left
chest tube was discontinued.

Echo was done POD 2 and normal. On POD 2 he was volume
overloaded and lasix gtt was started which he responded to.

POD 3 he developed afib which quiesced after diltiazem gtt. This
was nicely transitioned to oral ditiazem without any more afib.

POD 4 he was transfused 1 unit of PRBC's for low hct and to
assist in oxygenation and blood pressure. His diet was advanced
but his abdomen was quite distended prompting KUB which was
positive for ileus. Suppositories and stool softeners were
continued and he had a bowel movements without nausea vomiting
and less abd distention thereafter. Methylnaltrexone was given.

POD 5 he transfered to the floor. PT evaluated him and he was
not found to have home PT needs. He was deemed stable for
discharge on [**2147-7-31**] with VNA. Foley was dc'd [**2147-7-30**] with good
urine output.

CXR's were serially watched without evidence of stump leak. Pain
was initially controlled with dilaudid and bupivicaine epidural,
which was split postop for hypotension. He titrated off epidural
and PCA early on and tolerated po dilaudid for effective pain
control along with tylenol.

CXR:
[**2191-4-12**]:The previously present right-sided chest tube
terminating in the apical area has been removed. No pneumothorax
has developed. A right-sided chest tube terminating in the
pleural space on the right lung base remain in unchanged
position. No new pulmonary or pleural abnormalities are seen.
The amount of remaining pleural effusion in the posterior
pleural sinus appears grossly unchanged when comparing the
findings on the lateral views.
[**2191-4-9**]: Improved aeration in right lung compared with earlier
the same day However, considerable persistent opacity diffusely
throughout right lung, which appears to represent a combination
of diffuse
alveolar opacity and pleural thickening and/or fluid.
2. Retrocardiac patchy opacity, worse compared with the most
recent prior
film.

[**2191-4-4**]: Improving right upper lung postoperative hematoma
Decreased asymmetric right pulmonary edema. Decreased minimal
bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged small left and tiny right pleural effusions
[**2191-4-3**]:  The patient is status post right upper lobe
resection. Large
homogeneous opacity extending from the right apex to the right
hilum appears similar compared to the previous post-operative
studies and could reflect a large hematoma. Heart size remains
normal. Linear bibasilar atelectasis is present, left greater
than right, with interval worsening on the left compared to the
prior study. Small left pleural effusion is apparently new.
[**2191-4-1**]: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube remain in place. The changes of right upper lobectomy are
redemonstrated as is right pleural fluid, presumably hematoma.
The degree of subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe
has improved and right middle lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
[**2191-3-30**]: New right lower lobe opacity is consistent with large
right lower lobe atelectases. Patient has known right middle
lobe atelectases. There is probably a small right pleural
effusion. The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right
side. In the left lung, there is a small left pleural effusion
and left lower lobe atelectases.
[**2191-3-26**]:  new right paramediastinal opacity, which is
concerning for either mediastinal hematoma or newly developed
atelectasis of right middle lobe with questionable torsion.
CCT
[**2191-3-27**]: Area of contrast extravasation in the expected
location of the right middle lobe.
A severe narrowing, just distal to the origin of the artery
supplying the
right middle lobe and incomplete visualization of the right
middle lobe
bronchus are concerning for right middle lobe torsion with
active
extravasation into a small hematoma in the region.
Atelectasis in the superior segment of the right lower lobe.

Echocardiogram
[**2191-3-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded, but none are seen. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are grossly normal. There
is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4949**] was admitted [**2191-3-25**] following Video-assisted
thoracic surgery (VATS)  right upper lobectomy and mediastinal
lymph node dissection.  He was extubated in the operating room,
monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the floor with a left
chest tube, Foley, Dilaudid PCA for pain.

Event: [**2191-3-31**] flexible bronchoscopy in the operating room,
transfer to the ICU intubated, bedside bronchoscopy [**2191-4-1**]
successfully extubated, transfer to the floor [**2191-4-2**].

Respiratory: incentive spirometer and nebs were done. On
[**2191-3-28**] his chest film showed right middle collapse.  He was
taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy with showed large
mucus plug. He transfer to the floor in stable condition.  On
[**2191-3-31**] his CXR showed collapsed right lung he was taken to the
operating room for flexible bronchoscopy and removal of small
clot in the distal bronchus intermedius. He transfer to the ICU
intubated for positive pressure support. He underwent bedside
flexible bronchoscopy on [**2191-4-1**] and was successfully
extubated. With continued  aggressive chest PT, nebs and good
pain control he titrated off oxygen with saturation off 93-95%
RA at rest and with activity. Pt was transferred to the floor
with improving oxygen saturation.  Series of quotidien fevers
and spike to 101.8 [**4-6**] prompted CT chest concerning for
infection/necrotic RML.  Taken to OR [**4-7**] for R thoracotomy,
RMLobectomy and placement R chest tubes x 2, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain.
Tolerated procedure well and was xferred to the SICU for
extubation on [**4-8**].  Bronchoscopy performed [**4-9**] for concern of
mucus plugging in RLL.  CXR improved post-procedure.
Transferred to floor [**4-10**] satting well and ambulating. Pulmonary
toilet and ambulation were encouraged on the floor.  Room air
oxygen saturations 99% on discharge.

Chest-tube: right initially with a large amount of drainage,
slowly taper off and was removed on [**2191-3-30**].  Two additional R
chest tubes and [**Doctor Last Name **] drain placed in OR [**4-9**].  R antero-apical
CT d/c'd [**4-11**].  R postero-apical CT d/c'd [**4-12**].

Chest-film serial CXR showed see above reports.

Cardiac: intermittent atrial fibrillation 100-140's.  He was
started on amiodarone infusion converted to sinus rhythm within
24-48 hrs, but continued to have intermittent atrial
fibrillation with rates of 140-150's with hypotension requiring
low-dose pressors, IV amiodarone & PO 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] transitioned to
200 mg daily [**2191-4-6**] after completing 6 gm load.  Diltiazem was
started for RVR and titated too 30 mg qid. He converted to sinus
rhythm [**2191-4-3**] 50-60's on amiodarone and diltiazem and remained
in sinus. The cardiac enzymes were negative.  Echocardiogram
[**2191-3-27**] with  Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with low
normal global systolic function. No pericardial effusion. No
left atrial dilation.  Amiodarone and diltiazem were titrated in
relationship to HR and systolic blood pressure with patient
intermittently alternating between afib and sinus rhythm. On
discharge his he was in sinus rhythm 60's.  Blood pressure
130-140 stable.

GI: PPI and bowel regime.  Tolerated a regular diet

Renal: Foley required re-insertion for low urine output. Over
his hospital course he was hypervolemic reqiring gentle
diuresis. His renal function was normal. His electrolytes were
replete.  Serum creatinine increased from 0.9, Peak 2.8 in
setting of tobramycin, vancomycin, flagyl, zosyn for RML
necrotizing PNA s/p resection.  Tobramycin discontinued.
Vancomycin and zosyn renally dosed.  FeNa: 1.1% and FeUrea 42%
consistent with ATN likely secondary to aminoglycoside toxicity.
 Electrolytes checked [**Hospital1 **].  His discharge CRE 2.7.  His Chem 7
will be monitored with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

ID: low-grade fevers with mild leukocytosis he was started on
Levofloxacin [**2191-4-2**] for possible PNA. Pan cultured with no
growth. Giving finding of necrotic RML, started on vancomycin,
tobramycin and zosyn [**4-9**].  Flagyl started [**4-10**].  Tobra
discontinued [**4-11**] in setting of ATN.  Flagyl discontinued [**4-11**].
Vancomycin was stopped with increased CRE, Zosyn dosed renally
continued until discharge on [**2191-4-14**] when he was changed to 14
day course of Moxifloxacin.  Infectious disease signed off and
will follow as needed.

Heme: Cardiology recommended anticoagulation.  He was started on
heparin/Coumadin bridge on [**2191-4-3**] he received 2.5 mg [**2191-4-3**]
(INR 1.3) [**2191-4-4**] 2.5 (INR 1.5).  Coumadin held and vitamin K
given [**4-8**] in preparation for OR [**4-9**].  Anticoagulation resumed
[**4-10**] with heparin gtt.  Coumadin resumed [**4-11**].  Heparin was
stopped [**4-11**].  His INR on discharge was 1.8.  He was instructed
to take 2 mg Warfarin and to follow-up with his PCP as an
outpatient.

Pain: Dilaudid PCA transition to PO with good pain control

Disposition: Home with his wife and [**Name (NI) 269**] on [**2191-4-14**].  He will
follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for warfarin follow-up and Dr.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63 year old man with recent diagnosis of widely metastatic
undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, likely of the lung, transferred
from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further workup and to consider possible
initiation of palliative chemo or radiation. Patient presented
to OSH [**9-10**] after worsening substernal chest pain since [**Month (only) 205**]. He
first noted the pain after moving TV's, and he assumed it was
musculoskeletal. The pain was continuous, and exacerbated by
breathing and laying flat, and began radiating along the right
and left thorax. He also developed right shoulder pain and low
back pain during this time. Additionally, he has noted
increasing shortness of breath over the last few months and
developed an occasionally productive cough. He denies recent
fevers or chills and has not noted any weight loss. Denies
headache, changes in vision, or focal numbness or weakness.
Denies pain in hi calves. No nausea or vomiting, although his
appetite has been poor as of late. He denies bowel or bladder
incontinence. Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.

At OSH, an abnomral CXR led to CTA of the chest which showed
likely malignancy and metastatic disease including extensive
mediasitnal hilar LAD, rt chest wall soft tissue mass with bony
destruction of the adjacent right anteriorr second and third
rib, left posteriror chest wasll soft tissue mass with bony
destruction of the left posterior 8th rib, and mutliple
pathologic rib fractures. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed
multiple metastatic lesions within the liver, right adrenal
gland, left gluteal muscles, right groin, and a pathologic L1
vertebral body fracture with soft tissue impressing upon the
thecal sac. Biopsy of the rib lesion was attempted, but failed
due to patietn's inability to lie flat. Similarly, MRI of the
head could not be obtained due to inability to lie flat. Biopsy
of the gluteal lesion was obtained which preliminary report
showed undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. Of note, patient was
also treated empirically for PNA with levaquin and steroid
taper.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic back pain
- Possible COPD, no formal diagnosis
- Alcohol abuse. Sober for 4 months
- Hx of basal cell ca.
- Cellulitis/MRSA
- Left hip replacement
- Metastatic undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, likely of lung

Brief Hospital Course:
# Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung: The patient was admitted to
the ICU and was evaluated by oncology, radiation oncology and
palliative care.  With his poor performace status and advanced
disease, palliative radiation alone was offered to the patient.
Palliative care made recommendations for pain management with
plan to go home with hospice.  The patient was agreeable to the
plan.  He received one dose of radiation on [**9-20**] and was
discharged home with hospice services.

# Hypoxia: thought [**1-12**] possible pna with underlying copd and
splinting from pain of bony lesions.  He was treated initially
at the osh with steroids and levaquin.  The abx completed on
[**9-18**] and the steroid taper was continued on discharge.  He will
also go home with supplemental O2 and nebulizer treatments.

# Hypercalcemia: Initial Ca was 10.9 on admission.  He was
hydrated and given one dose of pamidronate.  Repeat calcium
level was 9.0.

# Goals of Care: patient will go home with hospice care.  He was
DNR/DNI.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after removal
of chest
tube.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to [**2161-6-20**] study obtained at 09:34 a.m.

Current study demonstrates interval development of minimal
apical
pneumothorax. The left lung opacity is unchanged as well as
right basal
atelectasis. Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of
cavoatrial junction. Small pleural effusion cannot be excluded,
in particular on the left.

CXR [**2161-6-22**]: Improved left effusion, no appreciable PTX

Echo [**2161-6-19**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 61723**] was taken to the operating room on [**2161-6-18**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for VATS left upper lobectomy and left port-a-cath
placement and by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] for resection of left thigh mass.
She recovered in PACU and transfered to SICU overnight for
respiratory monitoring and Bipap. On POD 1 she transferred to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9. Below is a systems review of her hospital course:

Pulmonary: Aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers and chest
PT were initiated early on. A left Chest tube was discontinued
POD 2, with stable postpull film, with improved left effusion.
The patient saturated on room air 94% ambulating on day of
discharge.

CV: The patient initially was hypertensive and tachycardic-
eventually controlled with addition of metoprolol- which was
added to her discharge regime. She remained in SR 70-80's on
discharge. Her home antihypertensives were continued. She was
diuresed with lasix POD 1. Echo was done revealing normal heart
function.

Nutrition/GI: Her diet was advanced and tolerated.

GU: Her foley was discontinued POD 1, and she voided.
Electrolytes were watched and repleted.

Endo: She had blood glucose monitoring throughout with blood
sugars which remained 150-350, despite augmenting her regime.
She will followup with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient next week.

Neurologic: The patient was given dilaudid IV postop then
successfully transitioned to po oxycodone and torodol for pain,
which was effective by date of discharge. She was slow to wake
up, but progressed over the first 24 hours in her stay. She was
seen by social work for depression and expressed SI, with a plan
but stated that she was not currently suicidal and if she
progressed in such thinking (per social work) she would talk
with her husband, psych and call 911.

PT: The patient was ambulating independently when PT came to

Right upper lobectomy with en bloc resection of ribs 2, 3 and 4.
and Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.  He was transfer to the TSICU
intubated and sedated.  He had 3 chest tubes to suction, Foley
and Epidural managed by the acute pain service.  On [**2128-2-24**] he
was successfully extubated.  Aggressive nebs and pulmonary
toilet his oxygen requirements improved to room air prior to
discharge.  He was followed by renal for ESRD and underwent
dialysis which was discontinued secondary to hypotension after
removal of 1 Liter. His hypotension improved with SBP 140's. His
chest tubes were placed to water-seal and 4hr f/u CXR showed
increase right apical pneumothorax. They were placed back to
suction with f/u CXR showing lung re-expansion.  His diet was
advanced as tolerated. On [**2128-2-25**] he transfer to the floor in
stable condition.

Respiratory: incentive spirometer, nebs and good pain control
his oxygen requirments improved.

Chest-tubes: 3 chest tubes, 2 apically and 1 along the right
hemidiaphragm with persistent air-leak.  On [**2128-2-25**] the suction
was decreased to 10 cm H20 from 20.
Chest tube were changed to water-seal [**2128-2-26**] without
persistent airleak.  Right hemidiaphragm chest tube was removed
on [**2128-2-26**]. [**2128-2-27**] another apical chest tube was discontinued
without airleak. On [**2-28**] the final chest tube was dc'd with
postpull chest film revealing stable R apical air space.

Cardiac:  Beta-blockers were initially continued.  On [**2128-2-26**]
he developed rapid atrial fibrillation in the 140's and was
given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3, with transient decrease in heart
rate. He then received amiodarone 150 mg IV, followed by
amiodarone gtt at 1 mg/min, with conversion to sinus rhythm.
Amiodarone gtt was stopped at around 3 a.m., and the patient was
started on amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg TID. He then went back
into rapid AF with ventricular rate 140s, for which he received
diltiazem 10 mg IV, however then had conversion pauses, up to 8
seconds. . Cardiology was consulted, and given the 8 second
pauses the patient was watched over the night in CCU. The
patient remained in sinus rhythm once converting, however had 2
minutes of rapid afib on [**2128-2-27**] without hemodynamic instablity.
He will followup with cardiology as an outpatient. All other
nodal blockers were held, until [**2128-2-27**], when labetolol 150mg po
bid restarted, and titrated to 300mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2128-2-28**], which he
tolerated well. His blood pressures were also high which we
slowly worked on adding home BP medications for control.
Cardiology recommended that patient be sent home with all of his
home medications, amiodarone will not be continued upon
discharge.

GI: Advanced diet to regular renal and tolerated.

Renal: ESRD followed by renal. HD continue, last on Saturday

postoperative pain management, with good effect. The patient
self dc'd on accident the epidural [**2128-2-27**] a few hours prior to
planned dc of epidural by APS. Heparin was held. The patient's
pain was controlled with oxycodone and tylenol thereafter.

CXR ([**2193-3-15**]): FINDINGS: The patient is status post left
pneumonectomy. Slight increase in amount of pleural fluid since
the prior study, with major air-fluid level now at the left
sixth rib level. Small loculations of gas in the mid and lower
left hemithorax has slightly decreased as well, and subcutaneous
emphysema has slightly decreased. Within the right lung,
ground-glass and reticular opacities at the right upper lobe and
more confluent opacity at the right base have slightly improved.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Sugery service after
elective operation. Her post-operative course is as follows:
.
Neuro: Epidural was placed pre-operatively which provided
adequate pain control. The epidural was removed POD 4 and she
was transitioned to oral pain medications with adequate control.
.
CV:  The patient's vital signs were routinely monitored. On POD
1 she developed hypotension with systolic pressures in the 60-70
range. EKG showed lateral T-wave inversions. Cardiology was
consulted and ECHO was obtained. This demonstrated EF >55%, no
wall motion abnormalities, mild dilated RV with moderate PA HTN.
She was started on aspirin per cardiology recommendations. She
was started on Neo for blood pressure support and was given
Albumin as well. On POD 2 she went into Afib with RVR which
resolved after IV metoprolol was given. Serial cardiac enzymes
were checked with peak trop of 0.11 likely demand ischemia, and
cardiac enzymes trended down. Cardiology recommended continuance
of medical management. She went back into AFib on POD 3 which
resolved with metoprolol. A repeat ECHO suggested low
intravascular volume and a central line was placed to assist
with fluid management. She was given blood and fluids to
maintain intravascular volume and the Neo was weaned off on POD
4. She remained hemodynamically stable thereafter for the
remainder of the hospitalization. On POD 6 she was noted to
become dizzy while standing up and was orthostatic. Hematocrit
was 24 and she was transfused 1 unit of blood. On POD 7 she
noted some chest discomfort after attempting ambulation with PT.
An EKG was checked and was unchaged and the discomfort resolved
spontaneously. She had no further episodes of chest discomfort.

.
Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Her chest tube was removed
after drainage was at an acceptable rate. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout this hospitalization. She required oxygen throughout
her stay with low room air ambulatory saturations. She was
discharged on home oxygen therapy.
.
GI/GU/FEN: Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.
The patient's diet was advanced to regular on POD 4, which was
tolerated well.  The patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IVF were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's
electrolytes were routinely followed during this
hospitalization, and repleted when necessary.
.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.
.
Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay. She was continued on her home thyroid replacement
medication.
.
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely. She received 2 units of blood on POD2 for hematocrit
of 24, with good response and then 1 unit on POD 6.
.
Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs with normal O2 sat on oxygen.  The
patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding
without assistance, and pain was well controlled. She was
evaluated by PT who recommended home PT which the patient agrees
to. She was discharged to home with clinic follow up. She will
wear home O2, and has home PT and VNA services set up.

[**2107-7-18**]: Right hydropneumothorax shows an air-fluid level that
is gradually increasing in height compared with prior
examinations after accounting for difference in techniques.
Subcutaneous emphysema unchanged from prior exam. The
mediastinum is displaced to the right status post pneumonectomy.
Lung in the left side is clear with no signs of pleural effusion
or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1005**] presented for pneumonectomy to remove the mass in
her right hilar region.

Neuro: She was transferred directly to ICU from the OR. An
epidural was placed for pain control. She was given Ativan for
sleep. She was extubated on POD 0.

CV: She tolerated the procedure well and was hemodynamically
stable throughout. On POD 2 she was noted to be mildly
tachycardic and so she was started on metoprolol 25mg TID, which
was effective. She was discharged on toprol 50 mg daily

Pulm: A chest tube was placed and was placed immediately on
water seal. She was transferred to the unit intubated but was
extubated soon after arriving on POD 0 and by POD 1 was on 2lNC
with good oxygen saturation. Her chest tube was pulled on POD 1
after having minimal output. She was weaned to room air without
difficulty and maintained good oxygen saturation throughout. Her
chest x-rays showed minimal mediastinal shift and progressive
filing of her right chest cavity.

GI: She was transitioned from clears to fulls to regualr diet by
POD 3 and tolerated POs well.

GU: A foley was placed in the OR and was kept in until the
epidural was taken out on POD 2. She voided after foley was
removed.

Heme: She had minimal blood loss in the OR and had a stable Hct.

ID: She was afebrile and had an initial leukocytosis thought to
be from the operation that normalized.

FEN: She was quickly transitioned to POs.

Pain: her pain was well controlled with oxycodone and

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1661**] is a 43 y/o female with a h/o advanced NSCLC dx
[**2138-8-14**] s/p chemotherapy x 6 cycles, who was originally
admitted to an OSH on [**2139-3-21**] due to severe nausea and vomiting.
Regarding prior cancer history, she is s/p 6 cycles of
chemotherapy with [**Doctor Last Name **]-alimta-erbiltix. Repeat CT scan [**2139-3-11**]
showed progression despite this therapy, thus she started
Taxotere on [**2139-3-18**]. Following this she developed severe N/V and
was unable to keep any fluid down. On [**3-21**] when she presented to
the OSH, with these symptoms and shortness of breath. She was
found to have pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. A
pericardial drain was placed [**3-21**]. On [**2139-3-24**] she underwent
bronchoscopy with limited left anterior thoracotomy with
creation of a pericardial window. Bronchoscopy revealed a
intraluminal lesion in her right main bronchus with almost
complete obstruction. She was uneventfully extubated
post-operatively [**3-24**] and transferred back to the medical floor
[**2139-3-25**]. As she continued to have shortness of breath and high
oxygen requirement, she was transferred back to the ICU on
[**2139-3-30**]. She was then transferred to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] with plan
for IP evaluation and possible stenting the following morning.
ABG at 0648 [**2139-3-30**] on 15L O2, 7.43/43/63. VS on transfer
112/59, 117, 37, 99, 95/NRB.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient able to speak in [**3-19**] word
sentences but overtly tachypnic with minimal exertion. Relays
history as above. Continues to have pain along lower left breast
after thoracotomy. Also intermittently feels like 'having a
panic attack' with increased shortness of breath and rapid
breathing. She is generally able to 'calm herself' through these
episodes and is unsure what causes them. She denies any
constipation. She was previosly able to go to commode up to 3
days prior but then SOB has inhibited her. She had a Foley
placed today when getting on the bedpan became too much work.
Sometimes talking can also be painful along her ribs. She last
ate this morning.

CT chest with contrast [**2139-3-31**]: 1)large right hilar mass which
infiltrates the collapsed right middle and lower lobes and
obstructs the right main stem bronchus just beyond its takeoff.
contiguous with extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy 2) large
right and moderate left pleural effusion and large pericardial
effusion.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. An apical
pericardial adhesion cannot be excluded. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. Brief RA invaginaiton is seen
(evidence of elevated intrapericardial pressure without overt
tamponade present).
.
TEE:
TEE done s/p pericardial window to assess for adequacy of
drainage. The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The pericardium
appears thickened. There are pericardial calcifications. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. All findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
.
Pericardial Fluid:
 	POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,
 	consistent with adenocarcinoma.
,
EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Low limb lead
voltage. T wave inversion in leads I and aVL, leads V2-V6 with
ST-T wave flattening in
leads II, III and aVF. These findings may represent
anterolateral ischemic
process. No previous tracing available for comparison. Followup
and clinical correlation are suggested. QTc430
.
Bilateral LENI: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the
lower extremities bilaterally
.
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2139-4-12**] at 6:03:31 PM
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is high
(>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic valve bioprosthesis with higher
than expected transaortic gradient which may be due to
hyperdynamic left ventricular function. No prior studies for
comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 y.o. Female patient w/ metastatic NSCLC s/p 6 cycles of
[**Doctor Last Name **]-alimta-erbiltix, taxotere with disease progression
transferred from OSH w/ pericardial/pleural effusion, RML/RLL
collapse [**12-16**] tumour burden s/p rigid bronch with debridement,
several pericardial windows/drain placement, pleuredesis.
Transferred from CT surgery to OMED for XRT with goal for
possible stenting of RML, RLL bronchus.

##. NSCLC/pericardial effusion: Pt has undergone 6 cycles of
[**Doctor Last Name **]-alimta-erbiltix, now on taxotere but with continued
disease progression.  Found to have an intraluminal lesion in
her right main bronchus with almost complete obstruction of the
RML and RLL for which she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with some
tumor debridement and recanualization.  Patient also received
XRT with original plan to shrink tumor enough to allow possible
stenting by IP.  However, patient had recurrent pericardial
effusion due to malignancy.  This effusion was originally
drained at her OSH prior to transfer, once tranferred she
underwent left and sub-xiphoid pericardial windows placed with
cardiac surgery. Despite this intervention, the patient's
respiratory status worsened, repeat TTE showed persistent
posterior loculated effusion with persistent tamponade
physiology.  Transferred to the CCU for further evaluation and
management on [**4-12**].  She was evaluated by cardiac and thoracic
surgery as well as interventional cardiology.  After lengthy
discussion it was determined that the only way to approach the
effusion was with open sternotomy.  The patient and her family
declined this intervention and indicated that they would like to
focus on comfort care. Ms [**Known lastname 1661**] is still interested in
pursuing palliative XRT as well as potentially any palliative
chemotherapy such as erlotinib that may be available to her.
Patient and family request transfer back to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] to be
closer to home.

#. SOB/hypoxia - likely multifactorial.  Patient has pericardial
effusion, pleural effusion, and obstructive lung malignancy.
Effusions around lungs and heart were already drained with
pericardial window x2 and chest tube, however with
reaccumulation of fluids.  Patient made decision to be comfort
care only and declined [**Doctor First Name **] further drainage of pleural
effusions.  IV fluids were intermittently bolused as needed to
keep preload elevated. Pt was continued on NRB 02 mask for
comfort and support.

#. Leukocytosis/UTI - pt has had a stably high WBC count in the
27-29's, but no signs of sepsis.  Possibly due to stress
reaction from pleurodesis or surgery.  Also has a Proteus and
Klebsiella UTI for which she was treated with ciprofloxacin for
a 7 day course.

#. Depression - pt was continued on celexa

#. AF with RVR.  The patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation
with RVR on [**4-12**] with rates to 170s.  BP remained in high
90-100s.  Returned to sinus rhythm with carotid sinus massage.
Digoxin was initially loaded, but his was discontinued due to
patient's preference for comfort care and maintenance of sinus
rhythm.  She has otherwise been in sinus tach to low 100s.

Pt and her family confirm that she is DNR/DNI and would like to
focus on comfort measures, they are however still interested in
learning about palliative treatment options such as
chemotherapy/XRT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2143-2-11**] and underwent successful
Flexible bronchoscopy, left pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymph
node dissection (lymph node stations 5, 6,
7, 9, 10). He was extubated in the operating room.  He required
a small amount of neo for blood pressure support.  His pain was
well controlled with a Bupivacaine/Dilaudid Epidural managed by
the acute pain service.  He was admitted to the SICU for further
management.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were
administred with improved oxygen requirements.  The epidural was
titrated down and neo stopped with a blood pressure in the high
90-100.  Gabapentin and acetaminophen were given for better pain
control. On POD1 the red rubber drain was removed with a sutured
placed for increased drainage.  He transferred to the floor. He
was seen by Speech and swallow who recommended a regular diet
with thin liquids. His home medications were restarted. On POD2
he 2 episode of atrial fibrillations with RVR in 140's and
converted to sinus rhythm with IV amiodarone bolus and IV
Lopressor. His electrolytes were normal. Cardiology was
consulted who recommended increasing his PO amiodarone 400 mg x
7 days and increase his beta-blocker to tid.   On POD3 the
epidural was removed and he converted to PO Dilaudid with good
pain control. The foley was removed.   On POD4 he remained in
sinus rhythm. He continued 1 Liter fluid restriction with good
urine output. On POD5 he continued to do well and was discharged
to home on Coumadin and with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.  He was
followed by physical therapy who deemed him safe for home.  He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] his
cardiologist as an outpatient.

lung cancer with tumor invasion of bronchi

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2173-2-25**] - flexible bronchoscopy

[**2173-2-26**] - Rigid bronchoscopy, tumor debridement using mechanical
debridement and cryotherapy of the right main stem/bronchus

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a  64 y/o female with a history of stage IV lung
cancer that was first diagnosed on [**2168**] and treated at that time
with chemoradiation therapy. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital on [**2173-1-12**] for progressive cough and weakness and
was found to have an enlarging right hilar mass, with associated
pleural effusion and a thoracentesis that yielded positive
cytology. She was considering palliative chemotherapy, but
unfortunately she has become progressively weaker, with
increasing and disturbing cough - productive of sputum lately,
and with worsening dyspnea. She denies any fevers or chills. She
was started on antibiotics (Zosyn) at OSH for a possible
postobstructive pneumonia.

During her hospital stay in [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital she was also found
to have recurrent SVTs with reentry, atrial flutter/fibrillation
in/out that had been partially responsive to iv diltiazem. These
have been completely asymptomatic and have improved considerably
with beta blockage. She denies any chest pain.

She is now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]/Interventional Pulmonology
service for evaluation of her airway and possible stent or other
symptom relief procedure.


Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Rheumatoid arthritis
Lung cancer - stage IIIb NSCLC, which has been in remission for
three years.  She was treated with chemotherapy and radiation
only.

SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had both hands operated on for
ligamentous issues secondary to her rheumatoid arthritis.  She
has also had her right foot reconstructed secondary to
rheumatoid
arthritis in [**2164**].  She has also had two biopsies, one from the
right clavicle and one from her right lung.


Social History:
The patient is unsure of her ethnicity background.  She is a
bookkeeper/cashier.  She used to smoke tobacco, but quit
approximately three years ago.  She does not drink alcohol.


Family History:
Significant for cancer of her father and two brothers, all lung
cancer.  Also, lung disease in general runs in the family.


Physical Exam:
VS 99.8  84  108/66  20  99 3.5L NC
Gen: NAD, A&O x3
CV: RRR
Chest: b/l diffuse wheezes, decreased BS at right base
Abd: soft, nondistended
Ext: WWP

Pertinent Results:
CT chest [**2173-2-26**]:
1. Following bronchus intermedius stent placement, persistent
airway obstruction distal to the stent, with minimally
aerosolized material, as well as encasement/marked narrowing of
the right pulmonary artery. Pronounced post- obstructive
collapse of the right middle and right lower lobe, which has
increased from the prior study. Pronounced volume loss is
evidenced by increased rightward mediastinal shift and elevation
of the right hemidiaphragm. Close followup is warranted.
2. Interval decrease in right pleural fluid following placement
of pleural
catheter at the right lung base.
3. Unchanged appearance of right suprahilar consolidative
opacity and right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe lung
masses.
4. Stable appearance of hepatic cyst and small hepatic lesions
in the right lobe.

Chest x-ray [**2173-2-27**]:
The mediastinum is currently more centrally positioned with
better aeration of the right lung that might represent overall
improved aeration of the right lung. Still present right
perihilar consolidation and right basal consolidation represents
a combination of known lung cancer, atelectasis and potentially
post-obstructive infection. The Pleurx catheter on the right has
been slightly repositioned. The left lung is unremarkable. There
is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-2-24**] and underwent
flexible bronchoscopy on [**2-25**] which deomonstrated tumor invasion
of the right mainstem bronchus and right bronchus intermedius.
She was continued on unasyn for treatment of presumed
postobstructive pneumonia and an admission WBC of 17.  On [**2-26**]
she underwent mechanical debridement and cryotherapy of the
airway with placement of a 12 x 20mm stent as well as placement
of a right sided PleurX catheter into the right pleural space.

On [**2-28**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy for further tumor
debridement and was taken back later that day for flexible
bronchoscopy and further tumor debridement a second time.
Postoperatively she was tachypneic and tachycardic and O2
saturations were transiently in the 50%s on room air; she was
placed on CPAP noninvasive ventilation and O2 saturations rose
quickly to the high 90%s. ABG at that time revealed significant
respiratory acidosis with 7.13/80/71, and she was planned for
admission to SICU.  After several minutes of CPAP her ABG
improved to 7.37/39/126, and upon admission to the SICU she was
transitioned off the CPAP to face mask.

Overnight she did well, however CXR in the AM of [**3-1**]
demonstrated collapse of the right upper lobe and a right
pleural effusion.  Her PleurX catheter was drained and she had
some symptomatic relief of symptoms.  She also underwent a
flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside which reportedly did not
reveal any abnormality, with the stent in good place.

She was evaluated by the radiation oncology department during
this hospitalization.  Given that she had completed 36 Gy of XRT
in the past, she was deemed not a candidate for Cyberknife,
however she could potentially undergo conventional
re-irradiation.  The patient and her family discussed her
options with radiation oncology as well as interventional
pulmonology, and she decided, given her grim prognosis, to
transition to a hospice approach to her care, with the intention
to go home as soon as possible.  Her wishes to be DNR/DNI status
were confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and on [**3-2**] she was transferred
from the ICU to the regular floor.

On [**3-3**] she was transferred to the floor.  Her WBC count was
down to 13 and she was afebrile throughout the admission.  She
was transitioned to PO augmentin for a total 14-day course of
antibiotics, and he was sent home for transition to home
hospice.

bronchi and SVC.  He was also noted to have a large pleural
effusion.  He was then seen on [**3-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was
scheduled for a SVC venogram with stenting prior to rigid
bronchoscopy tomorrow.  He thus presented today for SVC
stenting.
.
In the IR suite, he was given Fentanyl and Verset and the
obstructed SVC was stented with 3 stents (the first two were in
suboptimal position, so a third was placed).  Per report, the
patient then developed sinus tachycardia at the end of the
procedure, which was reportedly thought to be secondary to
either pain or dehydration.  There was concern because the
patient was in sinus tach at the end of the procedure.  He was
admitted overnight to medicine for observation until the rigid
bronchoscopy tomorrow morning.
.
On the floor, the patient immediately triggered for AFib with
RVR with rates to the 140s and stable BP.  He states that he has
a history of AFib, but he does not take any medication for it.
He was incredibly anxious and stated that he wanted to leave the
hospital and no longer wants the procedure tomorrow.  After
discussion with the patient and his wife, he agreed to take
medication for treatment of his anxiety but otherwise deferred
further medical management for his AFib.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o AFib
who presented to the IP suite for SVC venogram and bronchoscopy
with right mainstem stent placement.
.
The obstructed SVC was stented with 3 stents; pt then developed
sinus tachycardia and was admitted to SIRS (medical floor) on
[**2165-3-14**] for observation until rigid bronchoscopy planned for the
next morning. Upon admission to SIRS, pt triggered for AFib with
RVR (HR 140s, BPs stable). He initially refused cardiac meds and
would only accept Ativan. Tachycardia subsequently resolved and
pt was taken for rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy on [**2165-3-15**]. Plan
was to stent right mainstem bronchus but this was not possible
given obstructive nature of tumor and its friability. Biopsy was
taken and sent for stat pathology.  Pt was intubated for the
procedure and extubated afterwards but became agitated and
hypoxic. Due to worsening hypercapnia and agitation, he was
re-intubated and transferred to MICU. He was re-extubated
without difficulty at the MICU. He did also have a troponin leak
that was believed to be [**1-23**] demand ischemia in setting of afib.
Plan initially was to have pt go home and return for XRT as
outpatient, particularly as pt reluctant to stay in hospital.
However, pt's HR was unstable and he was transferred to OMED for
further management and initiation of radiation. Final RLL lung
pathology pending at the time of discharge.
.
Pt was seen by radiation oncology and had XRT mapping as well as
his first session of XRT on [**2165-3-18**] prior to discharge. He did
have an episode of AF with RVR he morning prior to discharge,
which was managed with po metoprolol. He was also given Ativan
for anxiety, which was felt to be precipitating the rapid HR. He
will be discharged on 100mg of metoprolol succinate for rate
control.
.
Pt was confirmed full code this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10010**],
It has been a pleasure taking care of you here at [**Hospital1 771**]. You were admitted to the hospital
because you have a mass in your lungs that is causing
compression on your right mainstem bronchus (the large airway).
While you were here, you underwent a stent placement in your
superior vena cava, one of the large veins returning blood to
the heart.  Furthermore, you had a stent placed in your right
mainstem bronchus to improve your breathing.  You also had an
episode of a fast heart rate, called AFib (atrial fibrilation)
with rapid ventircular rate or RVR, which we think was worsened
by your anxiety.  We gave you a medication called Ativan for
anxiety, and started a medicine called metoprolol for your heart
rate.
.
While you were here, we made the following changes to your
medications:
- You may start lorazepam (Ativan), as needed, for anxiety. We
gave you a small number of pills. You should talk about whether
or not to continue this medicine with your primary care doctor.
- Please START metoprolol succinate 100mg daily
- Please take 20mg (5 pills) of dexamethasone with dinner the
night before and breakfast the day of chemo.
- Please START taking a baby aspirin (81mg) daily.
- Please START taking omeprazole 40mg daily. This is to help
protect your stomach while you are taking dexamethasone. Your
first dose of chemo will be Thursday at [**Hospital1 **].
- You did a great job not smoking while you were here in the
hospital. We highly recommend you continue to not smoke, and
have given you a prescription for nicoteine pathces to help. All
of your doctors are here to support you in quitting!

Imaging:

CT head [**2158-10-19**]: No acute intracranial abnormality. No evidence
of intra or extra-axial lesion in this non-contrast study.

LENIs [**2158-10-18**]: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

CXR [**2158-10-18**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the most
lateral right aspect of the right hemithorax is missing. With
this limitation in mind, there is no relevant difference as
compared to the previous examination. The monitoring and support
devices are in unchanged position. No evidence of complication,
notably no pneumothorax. Unchanged moderate right hilar
enlargement, with relatively diffuse and many peripheral right
parenchymal opacities. The extent of the pre-existing right
pleural effusion cannot be determined given that it is not
visualized. No abnormality is seen in the left lung. Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette.

CT chest w/o contrast [**2158-10-15**]: 1. Large infiltrating right hilar
mass occluding the bronchus intermedius and portions of the
right middle lobe and right lower lobe proximal bronchi. There
is extensive mediastinal adenopathy including a large precarinal
node, which may be contiguous with the dominant hilar mass.
Several suspicious spiculated satellite nodules are also noted
within the right middle and right lower lobe with additional
suspicious left lower lobe nodule. Superimposed presumed
post-obstructive bronchiolitis is seen in the right upper, right
middle and right lower lobes. Known underlying centrilobular
emphysema.

2. Large hypoattenuating right hepatic lesion presumably site of
biopsy-
proven metastases. Several subcutaneous soft tissue nodules are
present which is an atypical location for lung metastases. A
concomitant second malignancy such as melanoma is not excluded.
Several of these lesions are not located at sites typically used
for subcutaneous injections.

3. Small right pleural effusion and trace perihepatic ascites.

4. Atherosclerotic disease including coronary artery
calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 73953**] was a 76 year old woman with PMH of COPD on home O2
of 3L NC, HTN, CHF, IDDM, PVD with stents to bilateral legs,
recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with mets to the liver
who presented with progressive shortness of breath requiring
non-invasive ventilation at OSH and was intubated to protect her
airway and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of the right
bronchus intermedius as a means to potentially improve her
baseline shortness of breath.
.
Respiratory failure: The patient had progressive shortness of
breath that required noninvasive ventilation at OSH. She was
electively intubated to protect her airway prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Her repiratory failure was in large part secondary to
collapsed airway secondary to obstruction by her NSCLC.  LENIs
were negative.  Nebulizers were continued.  Theophylline was
held.
.
Lung cancer with airway obstruction:  IP was consulted on
admission.  Review of CT from 2 weeks prior demonstrated
near-complete collapse of bronchus intermedius.  IP performed
bedside bronchoscopy via her ET tube and found now complete
collapse.  Because of the anatomy of her occlusion, stenting was
not possible. She received the first of 2 palliative radiation
treatments without improvement in her respiratory status.  Due
to progressive oxygen requirements and poor prognosis, decision
was made with her husband and children to change focus of care
to comfort.  She was extubated the morning of [**2158-10-21**] in the
company of her extended family.  She was given a morphine drip
and passed away at 11:10am.  Family denied autopsy.  Admitting
notified.  [**Location (un) 511**] organ bank was notified prior to
extubation and, but unfortunately patient was not a candidate
due to her malignancy and active post-obstructive pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 56839**] was admitted to the SICU following her left lower
lobectomy on [**11-26**] after she required re-intubation in the PACU
postoperatively.  The following summarizes here SICU course from
[**11-26**] - [**12-6**]:

Neuro:  Pain control was achieved with an epidural, which was
split to bupivacaine with a dilaudid PCA.  The epidural was
removed on [**12-1**] and she was transitioned to PO pain medications,
which she tolerated well.

CV:  Home cardiovascular medications were started
postoperatively when patient was able to tolerate POs.  She
remained hemodynamically stable throughout her ICU course.

Resp:  Ms. [**Known lastname 56839**] was extubated on POD #1 and transitioned to
face mask.  Overnight she required noninvasive CPAP to maintain
O2 saturations > 90%.  Bronchoscopy [**11-26**] demonstrated no
abnormality postop.  CXR on [**12-2**] demonstrated LUL collapse and a
bronchoscopy was performed with mucus plug extraction.
Throughout the next several days Ms. [**Known lastname 56839**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] daily
bronchoscopy as she continued to have L-sided mucus plugging
with LUL collapse on CXR.  On [**12-4**] she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] CT chest with
again demonstrated LUL collapse.  Repeat bronchoscopy on [**12-5**]
and [**12-6**] yielded decreasing amounts of mucus and on [**12-6**] her CXR
began to show signs of improvement.  Meanwhile her O2 requrement
decreased from nightly CPAP to 6L O2 by NC and finally to 3L O2
by NC with pulmonary toilet.

GI:  Diet was NPO for the first 48 hours postoperatively and
then advanced to a regular diet, which she tolerated without
difficulty.  She did not have a bowel movement for several days
and was given colace, senna, and dulcolax in the SICU prior to
transitioning to the floor.

GU:  A foley catheter remained in place until [**12-5**] due to her
poor mobility and decreased urinary continence at baseline.  It
was replaced [**12-6**] after multiple episodes of incontinence
overnight.

Heme:  Hemodynamically stable without requirement for
transfusions of blood products.

ID:  She was treated with vancomycin and levaquin for presumed
pneumonia, with GPCs and GNRs on BAL [**12-2**] and [**12-5**].  WBC
remained < 10 and she was afebrile throughout her hospital
course.  Vanc and levaquin were discontinued on [**12-9**] and [**12-11**],
respectively.

Endo:  Regular insulin sliding scale was used for hyperglycemic
control.

Patient was transferred to the floor and continued her hospital
course. The following summarizes her hospital course from [**12-6**]
to [**12-10**]:

On [**12-6**] (POD10) patient was transferred to the floor after a
bronch revealing no mucous plug and a post-bronch CXR that
showed improved aeration of the left lung. On POD11 patient was
feeling better, was out of bed twice and releived her
constipation, responding to a bowel regimen. Between POD12 and
POD14 she continued to improve progressively from a respiratory
standpoint and walking short distances progressively. Her foley
catheter was placed again per patient request, and after
multiple advices from the medical team to discontinue it, as it
could raise the possibilities of urinary tract infections, but
due to her morbid obesity she felt more comphortable to keep it
for a few more days on her postop period. No evidence of UTI was
found during her hospital stay and this will be pulled at her
rehab facility. Her CXRs continued to show a moderate amount of
pleural fluid on the left base, so it was felt that she would
benefit from an ultrasound with possible tap of her pleural
effusion. Interventional pulmonology was able to drain 800cc of
serosanguinous fluid and samples were sent for analysis, culture
and cytology (pending). She felt her breathing was better after
that and will continue to work on her incentive spirometer, and
overall pulmonary toilet. As per physical therapy's
recommendations she will need a short term rehab to be able to
get to her baseline activities, and will follow up as an
outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

returning as a 2.6 cm well to moderate differentiated mucinous
adenocarcinoma , neg nodes, clear margins. (pT1N0Mx, stage 1A).
He has had a persistent density 3.5 cm in lateral RUL since
surgery, now denser and FDG avid. His FNA ([**2155-8-12**]) was
nondiagnostic with occas groups of large atypical cells thought
to be glandular in nature or reactive. Repeat PET [**2155-4-3**]
once
again shows FDG avidity (SUV 4.8). [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 112102**] [**2155-7-4**]

He presents for eval for possible RUL lobectomy and discussion
with multidisciplinary team.

Pt. has had PFT's [**2155-4-30**] which show FEV1 114% and DLCO
corrected 64%. This is discordant however with clinicsl
assessment. He is short of breath walking down the [**Doctor Last Name **] and is
at
most able to climb one flight of stairs with significant
dyspnea.
No cough, chest pain, wt loss, fevers.

He has local recurrence at the site of his previous RUL staple
line. He has not been able to do the Cardiopulmonary Exercise
Stress Test due to mobility issues. PET is negative for
metastatic disease. His repeat PFT's show FEV1 of 103% and DLCO
of 50%, which is consistent with his previous PFT's done at the
time of his 1st surgery.

CXR [**2155-9-17**]
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
post-surgical staples
are in unchanged position.  Also unchanged is the right chest
tube.  Other
than on the previous examination, no overt pneumothorax is seen
on today's
examination.  The selective left intubation has been removed and
changed to
endotracheal tube with the tip positioned approximately 1.8 cm
above the
carina.  The contours of the right main bronchus are not
visible.  Whereas the
left lung appears normal, the post-operative right lung is
substantially
decreased in size after lobectomy and evidence of post-surgical
parenchymal
opacities.  Moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  No
larger pleural
effusion.

CXR [**2155-9-21**]
A small apical pneumothorax is present.  This was not present or
was obscured on the prior chest x-ray.  The position of the
right chest tube is unchanged.  The left lung field remains
clear.

CTA [**2155-9-23**]
CONCLUSION:

1.  Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal.
There is no
central pulmonary embolism, but the exam is not diagnostic
distally.
2.  There is no acute aortic syndrome.
3.  Patient with recent right upper lobe lobectomy with residual
small pleural effusion and small-to-moderate pneumothorax.
Chest tube is in adequate position.
4.  Bilateral, more prominent on the left side independent
portioned
ground-glass opacities around severe emphysema is mostly
compatible with
pulmonary edema as seen in previous chest x-rays.

CXR [**2155-9-24**]
Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the low lung volumes.
 Widened
mediastinum is stable mainly due to mediastinal fat as seen in
prior CTs.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Right apical
small
pneumothorax is stable.  Small right pleural effusion is
unchanged.  Right apical chest tube is in unchanged position.
Right hilar surgical chain is noted.  There are no new lung
abnormalities.  Skin staples are present in the right
hemithorax.

CXR [**2155-9-24**]
In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is some
increase in the degree of right upper lung pneumothorax.
Otherwise, little change.

CXR [**2155-9-28**]
Mild interstitial edema is unchanged.  Patient has known
emphysema.  Small right pneumothorax is stable.  Small amount of
right pleural effusion is also unchanged.  Cardiac size is top
normal.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Postoperative changes
in the right perihilar region are again noted.  There are no new
lung abnormalities.  Skin staples in the right chest are again
noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112101**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a right upper lobectomy for recurrent
NSCLC on [**2155-9-17**]. He tolerated the procedure well and was
extubated in the OR. However, he had to be reintubated in the OR
due to respiratory distress and was put on a neo drip for
hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
POD #1 he was extubated and maintained on bipap. He continued to
require the neo drip for hypotension. His chest tube was put to
waterseal. On POD #2, he started his epidural for pain control,
and started on a clear liquid diet, which he tolerated well. On
POD #3 ([**2155-9-20**]), he was weaned off the neo drip and on POD #4
he was transferred to the floor. His foley was removed and he
voided successfully. On POD #5 he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] a clamp trial, which
showed no increased pneumothorax on chest xray. However, later
that day, he desaturated on the floor, was tachycardic to the
130s, had increasing anxiety and pain, and was transferred to
the ICU for concern for PE and increased confusion. A CTA was
obtained which showed no evidence of a PE. On POD #6, he
continued to have some residual agitation and confusion in the
morning, which resolved by the afternoon. Due to concern for
fluid overload and pulmonary edema, he was given lasix 20 IV
twice. On POD #7, his chest tube was removed with minimal change
in the size of his pneumothorax. He had some shortness of breath
in the afternoon requiring CPAP. He received another dose of
lasix 20 IV. On POD #8, his respiratory status continued to
improve and he was maintained on 3L of O2 and given two more
doses of lasix 20 IV. On POD #9, he was transferred to the
floor. He continued to have an oxygen requirement at 3-4L and
congestion on chest xray. We continued to diurese him with PO
lasix.  His blood sugars were well-controlled during this time
on metformin and sliding scale insulin. His pre op Verapamil was
resumed at his home dose of 180 mg daily but over the last 48
hours his blood pressure has ranged from 92/60 to 118/70.  He is
asymptomatic but his daily dose will be decreased to 120 mg
daily to start [**2155-10-1**]. The patient was unable to ambulate
independently, so physical therapy recommended discharge to
rehab. He was discharged to rehab on [**2155-9-30**] in good condition
with instructions to follow-up in clinic on [**2155-10-14**] with a chest
xray beforehand.
Of note, his final pathology report was reviewed with him in
depth by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and he will also see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] from
Medical Oncology at his first post op visit.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2199-7-26**] for Right thoracotomy via
Right upper lobectomy.
with Mediastinal lymph node dissection.  He was extubated in the
operating room monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the
floor.  On [**2199-7-27**] he was noted to have increased ""facial
edema"" and subjective respiratory distress. Exam showed
increased subcutaneous emphysema tracking on the right tracking
to his face. Both chest tubes were to water seal with a large
leak. He was transferred to the TICU.  The chest tube were
placed to suction, with improvement in his respiratory status.
On [**7-28**] he developed respiratory distress with oxygen
saturations in the low 80's on face mask.  He was placed on a
non-re breather. Taken back to OR to evaluate for bronchial
leak/repair parenchyma leak.  He underwent Redo thoracotomy.
Creation of pleural tent. Application of tissue sealant to lung
parenchyma and Therapeutic bronchoscopy.  On [**2199-7-30**] he was
extubated, developed subcutaneous emphysema requiring
re-intubation.  On [**2199-8-1**] he had Flexible bronchoscopy which
showed continuous bronchopleural fistula that only improves with
complete occlusion of the right lower lobe.  He continued to
have respiratory distress with a large amount of secretions.  On
[**2199-8-3**] he underwent Flexible bronchoscopy, therapeutic
aspiration of secretions. Bronchoscopic guidance for
percutaneous tracheostomy tube placement(#8 Portex
nonfenestrated). On [**2199-8-4**] flexible bronchoscopy with clot
removal from left bronchus.

Respiratory: He tolerated Trach mask trial during the day with
CPAP [**4-6**] 60% overnight. Oxygen saturations 93-99%. Desaturates
with disconnection of T-tube. Thick blood tinged secretions
diminished with aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and chest PT.

Chest tubes: 2 chest tubes placed within the pleural tent to
suction for persistent air leak. they were placed to water-seal.
 On [**2199-8-5**] one chest was clamped for six hrs.  Follow-up chest
x-ray showed no pneumothorax subsequently the chest tube was
removed.  The remainder chest was removed on [**2199-8-7**].

Cardiac: atrial fibrillation with rate of 70-130's. Diltiazem
drip was started and converted to PO once able to tolerate with
good rate control 60-80's.  Blood pressure 100-130's.
Anticoagulation with Aspirin 325 mg.

GI: PPI & bowel regime

Nutrition: Tube feeds Novasource Renal with 35 g beneprotein
Goal 45 mL/hr via NGT.  Seen by nutrition whom recommended Boost
Control @ 85 ml/hr which he tolerated and converted to PO
without difficulty.

Speech: he was seen by speech for PMV and swallow evaluation.
He was cleared for PO diet: nectar-thick liquids and pureed
solids, Medications crushed with puree which he tolerated.  The
PMV he was unable to tolerate for any length of time.  He is
able to phonate around the #8 Portex non-fenestrated trach.

Renal: developed ATN peak CRE 2.8 base 1.2 secondary to
hypotension and low urine output.  Renal was consulted who
recommended increasing free water, prevent hypotension and
monitor renal function closely.  Renal US on [**2199-8-15**] showed no
renal stenosis or hydronephrosis. His foley was removed [**2199-8-22**]
and he voided without difficulty.

Endocrine:  DMT2 BS mid 200's initially on insulin drip
converted to NPH.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended changing
to Lantus [**Hospital1 **] with sliding scale adjusted as needed.  His blood
sugars improved over the course of his hospitalization.

Heme: Over the course of his hospitalization he was transfused x
3 for a HCT < 30.

Neuro: while in TSICU, intubated/sedated he develop delirium.
Geriatrics was consulted. His sedation was weaned off, his
delirium wax and waned on Zyprexa, Haldol at night which helped
with sleep and prn throughout his ICU course.  On [**2199-8-22**]
Geriatrics recommended changing Haldol to Seroquel. Please avoid
Valium. Offer diversional activities that can help distract
patients from removing
medical devices, such as Trach tubes. (He follows commands and
communicates easily via writing.

ID: ID was consulted on [**2199-8-1**] for high colony counts of P.
aeruginosa which was pan sensitive.  They recommended cefepime
and ciprofloxacin and  metronidazole to cover any oral anaerobes
not susceptible to the other agents. Last day of antibiotics was
[**2199-8-22**].

Pain: Epidural with 0.1% Bupivacaine and Hydromorphone managed
by the acute pain service.  While in the PACU his pain was not
well managed therefore the acute pain split the epidural with
Hydromorphone PCA with better pain control. On [**2199-7-27**] the
epidural became disconnected.  It was cleansed and potential
contaminated site removed and then replaced.

IV access: on [**2199-8-1**] a Left Basilic PICC placement, @58 cm.
This was removed on [**2199-8-5**] and tip sent for culture.  Replaced
to Right basilic 47 cm.  The patient removed his PICC line on
[**2199-8-22**] but was transferred with a peripheral IV.

Wound: Pressure ulcer 0.5 cm below tracheostomy improving with
Allevyn foam.

Disposition: he was followed by physical therapy and
occupational therapy.  He required a vent rehab and was
discharged on [**2199-8-23**] to [**Hospital3 **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 87066**].  The family was notified of transfer.

History of Present Illness:
58 yo F with recurrent stage IIIA NSCLC s/p carboplatin and
pemetrexed on [**2108-12-26**] and recent admission here for
gastroparesis who presented 2 days after discharge from here to
[**Hospital1 1474**] with similar symptoms.

There she was treated symptomatically. Cardiac biomarkers were
checked and noted to be elevated, with a Trop T of 4.9, CK
normal, EKG normal.  Cards was consulted, and she underwent a
stress test that was negative. She was treated with 48 hours of
heparin.  Per nursing report, stopped heparin [**2-6**] 'dropping
counts' and concern for HIT.  No HIT antibody testing in
discharge paperwork. GI was also consulted and recommended
symptomatic treatment with no EGD necessary, given recent EGD.
She was transferred here for further management and concern for
possible brain metastases given intractable N/V.  Of note, she
had an MRI in [**11/2108**] for same concern, which was negative for
metastases.
.
She triggered on arrival to the floor here at [**Hospital1 18**] for HTN to
200/100 HR 110.  EKG unchanged.  HTN likely related to
N/V/abdominal pain.
.
She reported mild epigastric pain.  She was diagnosed with
gastroparesis in [**10/2108**] based on a gastric empyting study after
presenting N/V.  She states that she rarely eats because she's
afraid to.  She's lost ~ 20lbs.  She denies constipation or
diarrhea.
.
ROS:
Denies CP, SOB, palpitations, cough, HA, change in vision,
dysuria, myalgias or arthralgias. She endorses depressed mood.

Past Medical History:
Locoregional Recurrent NSCLC
-- [**8-/2103**] presented with several months of persistent
cough unresponsive to antibiotics.
-- [**10/2103**] Chest x-ray demonstrated a density in the left mid
lung, which was confirmed by a chest CT.
-- [**11/2103**] chest CT revealing a 1.8-cm left upper lobe
spiculated
mass with pleural extension consistent with a malignant
neoplasm.
She also had a 2.6-cm right adrenal mass thought to be a simple
adenoma as well as a 2.1-cm left lobe focus of nodular
hyperplasia in the liver confirmed on an [**2103-11-23**] MRI.
-- [**2103-12-7**] staging with PET CT showing increased activity in
the left upper lobe nodule.  Brain MRI at the time of diagnosis
was negative.
-- [**2104-1-14**], she underwent a left upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node dissection with pathology revealing
adenocarcinoma with bronchioalveolar features well-to-moderately
differentiated in a 1.5 cm tumor.  She had lymphovascular
invasion and one of three peribronchial lymph nodes was
positive.
There was also a tumor in the periaortic lymph node in the AP
window region giving her a T1 N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung
cancer adenocarcinoma.
-- [**2-/2104**] She was treated postoperatively with one cycle of
paclitaxel and carboplatin, but was hospitalized post infusion
on
[**2104-2-22**] with chest pain, which was a ST elevation MI.  She
underwent emergent catheterization with a 60% LAD stenosis for
which she got a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She did not receive
further paclitaxel chemotherapy, but was started on a regimen of
cisplatin and vinorelbine, which she received a single cycle on
[**2104-3-26**], which was complicated by a MRSA UTI as well as a
decrement in her creatinine clearance to 57 mL/min down from
over
100.
-- She subsequently declined any further chemotherapy and did
not
receive radiotherapy either.
-- She did not continue to follow with her oncologist, but got
periodic CT scans via her surgeon and PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**2107-5-2**] CT with no evidence of recurrence, although a
small
nodule is noted in the left lower lobe measuring 3 mm, which had
not been reliably demonstrated on the prior study.  No
mediastinal adenopathy reported on the [**2107**] scan.
-- [**2108-10-21**] came to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with epigastric pain, emesis, and
dizziness.  She underwent an EGD with gastritis and gastric
emptying study consistent with gastroparesis.
-- [**2108-10-25**] CT which confirmed a new soft tissue abnormality in
the left mediastinum starting just distal to the aortic arch
associated with abnormal density surrounding the left main
bronchus posteriorly and small lymph nodes in the left hilum
suspicious for lung cancer recurrence.  She also had a small
pericardial effusion, a 2-mm right upper lobe nodule with
associated ground-glass opacity.  Again, seen was a 2.5-cm
adrenal lesion and a right hepatic lobe lesion.  She also
underwent on [**2108-10-25**] an MRI of her L-spine, which was stopped
for pain, but did not show metastatic involvement.  Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]
antibodies were negative.
-- [**2108-10-26**], she underwent a bronchoscopy with EBUS, which
showed a station 4L lymph node positive for malignant cells
consistent with nonsmall cell cancer.  The left main stem
bronchus biopsy was only notable for bronchial mucosa and a
level
7 node was negative.
-- [**2108-11-7**] PET CT on [**2108-11-7**], which confirmed a PET avid
paratracheal soft tissue density with an SUV of 6.7; a left
hilar
mass along the left main stem bronchus, which was also PET avid
at SUV of 4.9; and a non PET-avid 6-mm right hilar lymph node;
and 3-mm right lower lobe subpleural nodule.  There was no FDG
avidity seen outside of the chest and her adrenal mass is non
PET-avid.
-- [**2108-11-17**] MRI Brain: Subtle enhancement in the left parietal
leptomeningeal area felt to represent a tiny vascular lesion
like
a cavernoma. There is also question of an enhancing lesion in
the
left cerebellum but without associated mass effect or edema.
-- [**2108-12-1**] Chest CT with slight interval increase in
adenopathy,
no new findings.
-- [**2108-12-26**] C1 of carboplatin/pemetrexed
-- radiation therapy at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital
.

[**2109-1-29**] MRI Head
1. Interval enlargement of ill-defined contrast enhancement in
the anterior
inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, most suggestive of
progressing metastatic
disease, which could be leptomeningeal and/or parenchymal.
2. Stable small focus of cortical contrast enhancement, with a
possible
leptomeningeal component, in the parasagittal left parietal
region, which
could represent a stable metastasis, or a vascular malformation
such as a
cavernoma.

[**2109-1-30**] CSF
ATYPICAL.
Rare single atypical cell, not sufficient for definitive
characterization.

[**2109-1-30**] CSF Immunophenotyping
Non-diagnostic study.  Clonality could not be assessed in this
case due to insufficient numbers of B cells.   Cell marker
analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due
to insufficient numbers of cells.  If clinically indicated, we
recommend a repeat specimen be submitted to the flow cytometry
laboratory.

[**2109-2-1**] CT Head
There is also subtle edema in the left thalamus, which could
represent acute ischemia. Recommend evaluation with MRI.

[**2109-2-2**] CT Head
Stable hemorrhage in the left external capsule and lateral
putamen.

[**2109-2-3**] CTA Abd/Pelvis
1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia. Mild focal narrowing at
the origin of the SMA with associated post-stenotic dilatation
unlikely of clinical
significance with widely patent celiac axis and its major
branches.
2. Replaced left hepatic artery.
3. Previously noted 2.5 x 1.3-cm right adrenal nodule can be
characterized as an adrenal adenoma.
4. Fibroid uterus.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
58yo F with PMH recurrent NSCLC stage IIIA s/p chemo/XRT c/b
gastroparesis, a/w persistant N/V, hospital course c/b MICU stay
for HTN emergency w IPH, urinary retention, now w
well-controlled BP, foley out without retention, no
nausea/vomitting, discharged home.
.
ACTIVE
#  HTN: Patient was admitted with recurrent HTN episodes to SBP
220 in setting of vomiting and severe nausea, c/b
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage as discussed below. Baseline HTN was
thought to [**2-6**] nausea, vomitting, and urinary retention (found
on imaging, believed to iatrogentic from anticholinergic
medications).  Upon resolution of above issues, labile BP
improved so that patient no longer required anti-HTN
medications.  At time of discharge patient's BP was well
controlled w SBP 102-140 over 24hrs.  She underwent a workup for
pheochromocytoma w negative urine metanephs.  At time of
discharge serum metas were pending.
.
# Gastroparesis w N/V:  Patient with a chronic hx gastroparesis
of uncertain etiology ([**2-6**] radiation v chemo v paraneoplastic v
narcotics v tumor infiltration).  During hospitalization,
patient had improvement in nausea with narrowing of medications
(it was thought that baseline nausea was being exacerbated by
large amount of medications she was receiving).  Patient was
advanced to a regular diet and tolerated it.  At time of
discharge she was continued on standing reglan and ativan with
meals (all other anti-emetics discontinued).  It was decided to
defer a repeat upper GI series to the outpatient setting.
.
# Urinary Retention: During her hospitalization, patient was
found to be retaining large amount of urine and had a foley
placed.  It was thought that the etiology most likely iatrogenic
[**2-6**] to anticholinergic action of medications (e.g.
anti-emetics).  Her medications were narrowed, and she had her
foley pulled w/o additional retention
.
# s/p ICH: As mentioned above, on [**2-1**], in setting of HTN
urgency, patient found to have 1.8cm basal ganglia bleed on CT.
Neurosurg evaluated and felt that no surgical evacuation was
needed.  Repeat CT 24hr later was stable.  Her aspirin was
discontinued.
.
# NSCLC:  Patient w history of NSCLC w metastases.  Imaging
demonstrated stable metastases, with suspected brain met, but LP
showed only 1 atypical cell.  Patient was evaluated by neuro-onc
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60181**] who felt that LP and MRI head should be repeated
1mo after discharge.  Further therapy was deferred to outpatient
primary oncologist.
.
# Thrush: Patient found to have thrush during admission, thought
to be [**2-6**] inhaled steriod use.  Improved on nystatin and
floconazole.  At discharge, patient given script to finish 14d
fluconazole (d1=[**1-29**]).
.
INACTIVE
# Asthma/COPD: Well controlled.  Patient was continued on home
symbicort, albuterol, ipratropium, fluticasone propionate.
.
# Depression:  Continued home celexa.
.
TRANSITIONAL
1. Code status: Patient remained full code.
2. Pending: At time of discharge, plasma metanephrines were
pending and will require follow-up
3. Transition of Care: Patient was scheduled for follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**First Name (STitle) 60182**].  Patient will need to be scheduled for a
repeat MRI and LP 4 weeks after discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].

You were admitted for treatment of nausea, vomiting and high
[**Hospital1 **] pressure.  As a result of your high [**Hospital1 **] pressure, during
your hospital stay you had a small bleed in your brain.  The
bleed was monitored by neurosurgery; it stopped, and the team
decided that you did not need surgery.  Your [**Hospital1 **] pressure and
nausea were treated with medications and they improved.

During your hospital stay you were also found to be retaining
urine.  This was likely a side-effect of the many anti-nausea
medications you were on.  Your medications were changed and you
no longer retained urine.

During this hospitalization MANY changes were made to your
medications.  To avoid confusion, we ask that you throw away all
of your home medications, and fill the following prescriptions:
1) Lidocaine Patch - for pain
2) Metoclopramide (reglan) - for nausea
3) Lorazepam (ativan) - for nausea
4) Pantoprazole (protonix) - for stomach ulcer
5) Citalopram (celexa)
6) Folic Acid (folate)
7) Budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort) - for shortnes of breath
8) Fluticasone - for shortness of breath
9) Ipratropium - for shortness of breath
10) Fluconazole - to treat a fungal infection in your mouth
(take until [**2109-2-12**])

IMAGING:
CXR: NG tube tip is either in the distal stomach or proximal
duodenum.
There is residual contrast in the collecting system of the
visualized portion of the right kidney and there is also oral
contrast within the colon. The mediastinum is slightly
prominent, possibly due to supine technique. There is right
lower lobe infiltrate.
.
CTA:
1. No evidence of active bleeding in the small bowel.
Gastrointestinal
bleeding in the large bowel is unable to be assessed on this
examination
secondary to recent oral contrast administration from CT
examination performed at an outside hospital.
2. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease, some of which demonstrate
a soft
tissue component. Pathologic fracture involving the right medial
acetabulum. The largest metastatic lesions at L2, and the
posterior elements of L3 are at risk of pathologic fracture.
3. Calcified gallbladder wall likely an early porcelain
gallbladder.
4. Moderate simple right pleural effusion.
5. 7-mm left adrenal nodule likely myelipoma or adenoma.
6. Proctitis.

Colonoscopy ([**10-29**]):
Findings:
Flat Lesions - A single small angioectasia with stigmata of
recent bleeding was seen in the 60 cm. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
applied for hemostasis successfully.
Protruding Lesions - A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of
benign appearance was found at ~18 cm. A single sessile 5 mm
non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found in the rectum.

Excavated Lesions - A few non-bleeding diverticula with small
openings were seen in the distal sigmoid colon. A single
non-bleeding diverticulum was seen in the cecum.
Impression:
Polyp at ~18 cm
Polyp in the rectum
Diverticulosis of the distal sigmoid colon
Diverticulum in the cecum
Angioectasia in the 60 cm (thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
Recommendations: Patient should have a repeat flex sig with
polpyectomies and visualization of the rectum as an outpatient.
Clips were not used for AVM given likelihood that patient will
need MRI for ongoing treatment and care of her lung malignancy.
.
CTA Chest ([**10-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Large right upper lobe mass with probable lymphangitic spread
and
mediastinal invasion and compression of the right upper lobe
pulmonary
arterial and obliteration of a right upper lobe bronchus.
Extensive
mediastinal, subcarinal, and contralateral hilar
lymphadenopathy. Extensive bony metastatic disease involving a
left anterior third rib, numerous vertebral bodies, and the
sternum.
3. Increased size of a large right pleural effusion. Small left
pleural
effusion with atelectasis. Possible early aspiration has
occurred in the left lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening
that appears similar to the CT study performed two days prior.
4. Incidental note of an aberrant right subclavian artery.
.
CXR ([**11-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-26**]:
Large right hydropneumothorax is new since [**10-26**], including
substantial volume of right pleural fluid. Interstitial edema
has developed in the left lung, probably due to redirection of
pulmonary perfusion. Focal opacity in the perihilar left upper
lung could be pneumonia or aspiration. Followup advised. Heart
size is normal. Relatively mild leftward mediastinal shift
suggests central adenopathy anchoring the mediastinum.
.
CXR ([**11-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 7:01 p.m.:
Moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax is still substantial,
only mildly
smaller following the insertion of a small-bore catheter in the
right upper hemithorax. Interstitial edema persists because
there right lung is
substantially atelectatic, accounting for new small left pleural
effusion.
Mediastinal widening reflects extensive adenopathy. The heart is
non-enlarged but pericardial effusion is not excluded.
.
Pleural Fluid Cytology ([**11-2**]): Atypical.
  Rare groups of atypical epithelial cells.
  Heme slides were reviewed.
  Note: Recommend resubmission the entire fluid to cytology
  for cellblock preparation and further evaluation, if fluid
  reaccumulates.
.
Most recent CXR:
[**11-6**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the distribution and the

extent of the left pleural effusion are unchanged. On the right,
a small new pleural effusion could have developed. The
pre-existing air collection in the right soft tissues has
decreased and is in part not included on the image.  Unchanged,
however, are the increases of interstitial density, likely to
reflect interstitial fluid overload. Unchanged inhomogeneous
bone density, reflecting known lytic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yoF with metastatic lung cancer, who presented with an acute
lower GI bleed, found to have a bleeding AVM, with course
complicated by pleural effusion, with thoracentesis resulting in
pneumothorax, as well as severe malignant pain syndrome, now on
methadone and oxycodone.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# GI bleed, with acute blood loss anemia: Pt with BRBPR
concerning LGIB. Per report, NG lavage at OSH was negative,
given 1 unit PRBC, started on octreotide and Protonix drips and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. NG lavage was repeated on admission and
was negative, pt was transfused 2 additional units of PRBC with
appropriate response.  An angiogram was unsuccessful in
localizing a bleed, as PO contrast from a prior study at the OSH
obscured the study.  GI and surgery were consulted: surgery
rec'd GI to scope and GI rec'd scope in AM. After remaining with
stable Hct and blood pressure in the ICU, the pt was transferred
to the medical floor.  She then completed a bowel prep and
underwent a colonoscopy on [**10-29**], which showed a single AVM with
evidence of recent bleed, which was cauterized. Of note, no
clips were placed, in anticipation of possible future MRI that
pt's cancer management may require.  She was also noted to have
2 sessile polyps, which were not removed, and will require
outpatient flex-sig's for polypectomies at a later date.
.
# Pleural Effusion:  The patient was noted to have a large right
pleural effusion on CTA of the chest, performed to evaluate
tachycardia.  Given the size of the effusion, rate of
accumulation and her oxygen requirement, Interventional Pulm was
consulted to perform a thoracentesis.  Although her outpatient
imaging studies had already previously shown the effusion, and
was presumed to be a malignant effusion, no prior diagnostic
thoracentesis had been performed.  A bedside thoracentesis was
attempted by IP on [**11-1**], however, the patient developed a
moderate sized pneumothorax and an anterior chest tube was
placed at the bedside, with follow-up CXR showing good
resolution of both the effusion and pneumothorax.  Pleural fluid
analysis revealed an elevated LDH consistent with an exudate.
Chest tube was removed on [**11-3**] with no signs of reaccumulation
of effusion and only small amt of pneumothorax. Pleural fluid
cytology is pending at this time and showed atypical cells, but
not malignant cells.  However, this does not exclude a malignant
cause for the effusion.
.
# Metastatic lung ca, with malignant pain syndrome: pt is s/p
radiation and chemotherapy x 2 sessions.  Initially was
continued on her home pain regimen for her bone pain of
methadone 5mg TID.  Palliative care was consulted, with attempt
to increase her methadone, but she developed an acute
encephalopathy with higher doses of methadone, 5 mg po bid and
10 mg po qhs.  She also has prn Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
  She was noted to have a pathologic fracture of her right
acetabulum.  This was known prior to her admission, and
confirmed with her outpatient oncologist.  Orthopedics here
recommened that her activity be partial weight bearing as
tolerated, and that she ambulate with a walker or cane at all
times. Her outpatient Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31966**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] on
multiple occasions, but her functional status has declined
significantly and her ability to tolerate further chemotherapy
will need to be assessed after her strength improves.
.
# sinus tachycardia: initially thought to be [**1-31**] volume loss in
the setting of GIB, but it was not responsive to fluids or PRBC
overnight and has been persistently tachycardic during
admission.  Had 3 negative troponins to rule out active cardiac
ischemia, and also had normal TSH.  Pain adequately managed, and
receiving Ativan for anxiety as needed.  CTA showed no evidence
of PE.  Called outpatient PCP and Oncologist offices, pt's
baseline HR at previous office visits for the past year have
ranged in the low 100's to 110's.  Sinus tachycardia is likely
pt's underlying baseline due to underlying malignancy or her
COPD.
.
# Oral thrush: pt was noted to have some oral thrush on exam on
[**11-2**] and started on Nystatin.  She found this intolerable due to
nausea and was switched to oral clotrimazole with good effect.

.
# Acute cystitis: Pt was found to have acute cystitis on [**11-3**]
and started on a course of levofloxacin to be completed on
[**11-10**].  Levofloxacin used over cipro given equivalent E coli
coverage but better coverage of respiratory infections in this
vulnerable pt with ? infiltrate.  Plan will be to complete 10
days of abx for complicated UTI.
.
# Urinary retention: On [**11-3**] soon after UTI diagnosis an attempt
was made to DC foley but the patient developed urinary retention
and foley replaced.  Repeat voiding trial on [**11-9**] which she
again failed.
.
# Nausea:  She continues with nausea, likely multifactorial,
that is improved with compazine and zofran.  KUB on [**2181-11-8**]
showed no obstruction or ileus.  She will require continued
symptomatic management for nausea.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# COPD: continued flovent, albuterol and ipratropium nebs as
needed
.
Goals of care:
She was seen by palliative care, and there were extensive
discussions with her family, including her son, [**Name (NI) **],
regarding goals of care.  She will be transitioned to
rehabilitation with a goal of strengthening, and focus on
palliation of symptoms.  She remains a full code, per her son's
request, and is not fully aware of the extent of her disease,
again per family request.  Hospice may need to be considered in
the near future

Outstanding Transitional Issues:
1.  may need outpt flex-sig for polypectomies, assuming improved
clinical recovery.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred from [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU
with bloody stools.  During this hospitalization, you were
transfused red blood cells and underwent a colonoscopy for your
GI bleed.  A source of bleed was identified, and the bleeding
was stopped by cautery.  Some polyps were seen, and these will
need to be removed at a later date.  You were also noted to have
lots of fluid around your right lung, so you underwent a
drainage of the fluid, which was complicated by partial collapse
of the right lung, so a chest tube had to be placed.  You were
evaluated by the Physical Therapists, and given your
deconditioning and weakness, we think you will benefit from a
stay at a rehab facility.   You continue to have some nausea and
some pain, but you are otherwise stable.  You do have to have a
catheter in your bladder due to your inability to urinate.  You
need to get stronger before you can try any more chemotherapy,
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agrees with this.  You will also need to work
just on being more comfortable.
.
Medication changes:
1.  Decadron 4 mg for 3 more days
2.  Compazine around the clock.


Followup Instructions:

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
75 YOM with history of HTN who had progressive DOE and fatigue
over the fall with two courses of ABX for PNA with no
improvement.  He was sent for a CT of the chest [**2182-1-18**] which
revealed findings consistent with lung cancer in the left field
with metastases to the right lung, liver, bones and likely
adrenal glands.  He underwent a left sided thoracentesis on
[**2182-1-24**] with removal of 2L of fluid.  The cytology from the
pleural effusion showed adenocarcinoma with immunostains of the
tumor cells positive for CK7, [**Last Name (un) **]-31 and TTF-1.  He subsequently
underwent MR of the head and thoracic spine on [**2182-1-30**] which
showed diffuse metastasis.
.
He went to [**Hospital **] clinic this afternoon with progressive worsening
of dyspnea. Had 2 L taken off and was direct admitted to floor
for observation overnight and plan for pleuradesis or possible
pleurex cath placement in the morning with subsequent transfer
to OMED.
.
On arrival to the floor he was sattign 84% on NRB and nursing
triggered and transferred the patient to MICU six.
.
On arrival to the MICU he is comfortable lying on his right side
with O2 sats of 955 on NRB. He had minimal pain at the site of
the thoracentesis.

CTA CHEST [**2182-2-1**]
1. Acute pulmonary embolus in the right main pulmonary artery
with extension
to the right upper, right middle, and right lower lobe segmental
and
subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Additionally, there is a focal
opacity in
the right lower lobe which can be representative of a developing
infarct
versus a developing pneumonia.
2. Large left perihilar mass with extension and circumscription
to all lobes of the left lung and complete collapse of the left
lower lobe. Additionally, hypodense foci within the collapsed
left lower lobe are highly suggestive of tumor. Evidence of
lymphangitic carcinomatosis is visualized in the left upper
lobe. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is associated with
this tumor.
3. Two right lower lobe nodules which may be representative of
metastatic
foci, but are of unclear etiology. Additionally, there is
thickening of the anterior right pleura, which may be
representative of a metastatic focus.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
5. Although severely limited evaluation of the abdominal
structures, the
non-opacified visualized portion of the upper abdomen
demonstrates a
hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver which may be
representative of a metastatic focus. Further characterization
with a dedicated abdominal study is recommended.

[**2182-2-1**] LENIs
Left peroneal vein thrombosis. Right lesser saphenous
(superficial) vein thrombosis.

[**2182-2-2**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction. Normal global
left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

[**2182-2-1**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There continues to be large left pleural effusion and
there is a new right pleural effusion. There is hazy vasculature
bilaterally, left greater than right, compatible with fluid
overload. There continues to be some rightward mediastinal shift
similar compared to the film from the prior day.

[**2182-2-2**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax
with mediastinal shift towards the left. This is compatible with
increased fluid and associated volume loss. Right lung is clear
with the exception of some lower lobe alveolar infiltrate
medially similar in appearance to the CT scan from the prior
day.
IMPRESSION: Increased collapse of the left lung with complete
opacification of the left hemithorax.

[**2182-2-3**] CXR:
Compared to the prior study, there is no significant interval
change in complete opacification of the left hemithorax and
mediastinal shift to the left. There is a right lower lobe
infiltrate, similar in size compared to the study from the prior
day.

[**2182-2-11**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or infarction. The scattered small metastases which were
previously seen on MRI are not visualized on CT, even after the
administration of intravenous contrast. The ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and configuration. The basal cisterns are
patent. The dural venous sinuses in the vessels of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] enhance normally and symmetrically. No fracture is
identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells,
and middle ear cavities are clear. The soft tissues are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Known small metastases which were visualized on the recent
MRI are not visualized on this exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year-old male with stage IV lung CA with brain metastases
initially admitted directly from [**Hospital **] clinic for enlarging
left-sided malignant effusion and hypoxemia, admitted to the ICU
for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, then
transferred to the oncology service.
.
# Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma:  Cytology-confirmed diagnosis
with widespread metastases, a tumor in the perihilar region of
the left lung causing collapse and recurrent malignant effusions
made his prognosis particularly poor.  In addition to an
essentially non-functional left lung, his right lung was
compromised with a pulmonary embolism in the main right
pulmonary artery (see below). In addition to management of his
hypoxia and shortness of breath, the patient was initiated on
chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed in an attempt to
reduce his disease burden in the lung and thus reduce his
symptoms.
.
# Nausea:  The patient experienced nausea for several days
following chemotherapy.  This was treated with dexamethasone for
a three day course and Zofran pre-medication prior to meals.  He
continued to have nausea, but was able to tolerate a regular
diet.
.
# Pleural effusion:  The patient was first noted to have a left
pleural effusion in late [**Month (only) 404**].  On admission this was noted
to have reaccumulated and was again removed via thoracentesis.
Placement of a Pleurex catheter was considered, however the
patient preferred to wait to determine if chemotherapy could
reduce his symptoms.  He was provided high-flow oxygen and
nebulizer treatments.
.
# Pulmonary embolism:  The patient was found to have a pulmonary
embolism in the right lung.  TTE showed severe pulmonary artery
hypertension, likely representing the conditions in both lungs
creating back-pressure.  After weighing the risks/benefits of
starting anticoagulation, it was determined that starting a
heparin gtt with close monitoring was indicated at this time
despite the known risk of intracranial bleeding from metastases.
 His blood pressure was maintained below SBP 140 and DBP 110 to
help prevent intracranial bleeding.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was found to be elevated to
1.3, thought to be due to hypovolemia.  Urine electrolytes were
consistent with pre-renal process.  Resolved to 1.0 with
hydration.
.
# Hypertension:  Good SBP control will be important for him to
prevent catastrophic ICH.  Continued home medications, with
uptitration for SBP<140s, DBP<110.  In the two days prior to
discharge, his BP dropped slightly necessitating reduced
regimen.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with family
# COMM: patient, wife

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].  You were admitted to the hospital with
shortness of breath caused by fluid on the lungs (pleural
effusion).  The effusion was drained by a thoracentesis.  You
were also found to have a blood clot in the lung, a pulmonary
embolism.  This was treated with heparin, an anti-coagulant.
Your shortness of breath required oxygen support.  You were
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but after the
thoracentesis procedure your breathing improved and you were
able to be transferred back to the regular medical floor.

During your admission you were started on chemotherapy.
Following chemotherapy you had problems with nausea,
particularly in the mornings.  We treated this with anti-nausea
medications prior to each meal and on an as-needed basis.

We made the following changes to your medications:
- STOP Percocet
- START oxycodone for pain.  This is similar to Percocet.  If
you need more pain medication, please contact [**Name (NI) 24185**]
office.
- STOP hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, both blood pressure
medications, as your pressures have been low.  Continue
lisinopril.
- START folic acid
- START Lovenox injections, an anti-coagulant
- START senna for constipation
- START Zofran for nausea.  Please use this medication three
times a day before meals.
- START Zyprexa for nausea.
- START miconazole powder for groin rash

Please follow-up with your physicians as listed below.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
diagnostic thoracentesis [**2164-9-28**]

History of Present Illness:
73 year old male with history of HTN, CAD, COPD who presented to
[**Hospital6 3105**] on [**9-22**] with fatigue and positional
dyspnea.
Of note, the patient had been discharged from [**Hospital3 **]
approximately two weeks before after a hospitalization for
pneumonia. During that hospitalization the patient had remarked
on hemoptysis and chest imaging revealed a right middle lobe
lesion. He had a broncheoalveolar lavage during that
hospitalization and was discharged. In the interim between the
two hospitalizations, pathology of the cells from the lavage
revealed cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. This
unfortunately was not conveyed to the patient or family.
Upon the patient's second presentation on the 16th he was
diagnosed again with pneumonia; started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin. He received bronchodilators for presumed COPD and
was diuresed with furosemide 40 mg IV BID. Unfortunately,
despite these measures the patient's work of breathing remained
high and he continued to tire so that he was intubated on [**9-23**].
The patient's family was informed of his lung cancer diagnosis
after he was intubated. On [**2164-9-25**] the patient was extubated.
His effusion has been somewhat controlled on furosemide [**Hospital1 **] and
he has been satting reasonably well on [**1-11**] L of oxygen by nasal
cannula.  Of note, vancomycin was discontinued once blood,
urine, and sputum cultures returned without growth.
On the request of his family he is being transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further work up and management of his lung
cancer.  Currently, the patient appears in mild distress but
denies shortness of breath or pain. He denies any particular
complaints.


Past Medical History:
-CAD s/p MI eight years ago, managed with PTCA
-Hemorrhagic Stroke w/ craniotomy [**10/2162**] complicated by
recurrent bleed and seizure approximately 6 mos later

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o. male with significant smoking history and recent
diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer presenting with hypoxic
respiratory failure thought due to post-obstructive pneumonia
and volume overload now improving. The acute hypoxic respiratory
failure was believed to be multifactorial etiologies due to
obstructive lung cancer, compressive atelectasis due to large
pleural effusion, possible postobstructive PNA and very poor
pulmonary reserve due to underlying lung disease. Upon admission
to [**Hospital1 18**], patient appearred to be overall improving following
extubation, but still had significant work of breathing with
accessory muscle use.  He was continued on levofloxacin.  Chest
imaging revealed moderate right pleural effusions, as well as a
large right-sided perihilar mass with encasement of the trachea,
proximal portion of the right main bronchus, the right main
pulmonary artery, the right brachiocephalic vessel, and the
esophagus.  A few cc of fluid were aspirated by bedside
thoracentesis.  Hematology/oncology was consulted and discussed
treatment options to consider only after the patient recovered
from his critical illness.

Overnight on the night of [**9-28**], the patient had respiratory
arrest requiring intubation.  He also developed pulseless
electrical activity, requiring resuscitation with epi and
atropine. He had return of spontaneous circulation, but remained
intubated. Discussions were held between the MICU team and the
patient's wife and three children, when it was decided that the
patient clearly did not want to remain on artificial life
support for a prolonged period of time. His goals of care were
changed to focus on his comfort. He was terminally extubated and
passed away soon after, with his family at his bedside.

[**2101-6-19**] CXR :
 The patient is status post left pneumonectomy procedure.  There
is
expected leftward shift of the cardiomediastinal contours.
Slight increase in amount of fluid in the lower left hemithorax,
but majority of the pneumonectomy space remains gas-filled.
Right lung is overexpanded, and note is made of linear
atelectasis at the right base.  Subcutaneous emphysema persists
in the left chest wall.

[**2101-6-21**] CXR :
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to prior study.  There is interval expected increase
in the left hemithorax effusion with more superior location of
the air-fluid level.  Subcutaneous air on the left appears to be
slightly decreased.  Right lung is essentially clear.  Left
mediastinal shift appears as expected.  There has been interval
removal of the epidural anesthesia catheter.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a left thoracotomy with left
pneumonectomy.  He tolerated the procedure well and returned to
the PACU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics
and his pain was controlled with an epidural catheter.  His
rhythm was stable but he was placed on Lopressor
prophylactically fro atrial fibrillation.

He remained in the ICU until post op day # 2 at which time his
chest tube was removed and he was transferred to the Surgical
floor.  His epidural catheter was removed on post op day #3 and
he had adequate pain relief with Oxycodone and Tylenol. He was
evaluated by the Physical Therapy service to assess his
pulmonary status while ambulating and he was able to eventually
maintain ambulatory saturations of 93% on room air.

His WBC has slowly trended down since admission from 7K to 3K
today.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] was notified and will see him in the office
on [**2101-6-10**] for further testing.

He remained free of any post op arrhythmias and his Lopressor
was stopped prior to discharge as he had better blood pressure
control with his pre op amlodipine.  He was coughing and deep
breathing effectively and his right lung was clear on serial
xrays.  After an uncomplicated recovery he was discharged to
home on [**2101-6-23**] and will follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in 2
weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo male with hx of severe COPD with hx of hospitalizations
requiring intubations in the past, squamous cell lung cancer
with hx of LLL lobectomy, presents in transfer from [**Hospital1 **] s/p episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Complete records from [**Hospital1 **] are not currently available,
however, it appears that during that hospitalization an ABG
revealed pCO2 of 95, although it is not clear if that was his
peak.  He does require BiPAP at night with settings [**11-24**] with 14
backup rate, and 30% FIO2 to maintain O2 sat between 88 and 92%.
 During that hospitalization, he was treated with CPAP and
underwent bronchoscopy for concern of RLL collapse which
revealed mass obstructing the bronchus, and was confirmed to
have recurrence of squamous cell cancer.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for radiation therapy per recommendations
of their pulmonary consult, despite requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 112**]
where his oncologist is.
.
# Severe COPD, CO2 retention
Floor course unclear, however patient was initially admitted to
the floor, where BIPAP was not started.  Overnight [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] staff
was called to take the patient to the unit, secondary to
elevated CO2 and evidence of CO2 narcosis.  Patient was taken to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was placed on standing nebs, and he was placed
on BIPAP.  While on nighttime bipap his mental status improved,
he began speaking coherently and became A+Ox3.  On exam some
evidence of CO2 toxicity persists.  As definitive treatment of
this issue would be relief of dead space via XRT of his
obstructing SCC, and because his oncological care is at the
[**Hospital1 84145**] transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for initiation of XRT was undertaken.
.
Plan going forward:
- Transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for XRT
- Continue NEBS
- Continue BIPAP at 12/5 with 14 backup rate, and 30% FIO2 to
maintain O2 sat between 88 and 92%
.
# Squamous cell cancer, with RLL mass/RLL collapse
Bronchoscopically evaluated at [**Hospital1 **], found to have SCC
obstructing bronchus intermedius.
.
Plan going forward
-Transfer to [**Hospital1 756**] for continuity of care
-XRT as above
.
# BPH with hx of retention
- We continued his flomax
.
# Hx of dCHF (EF 50-55%)
- Per records, pt no longer on betablocker, diuretics, or other
cardiac medications, he never displayed signs of volume
overload.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after being transferred from
[**Hospital3 4107**] for having difficulty breathing resulting in
high carbon dioxide levels. Whilst you were there you were
placed on a BiPAP mask to help your breathing. You also
underwent a bronchoscopy which showed a RLL mass causing
bronchus obstruction of the RML and RLL. You were briefly
admitted to the medicine floor but then transferred to the ICU
after your oxygen level was noted to be low (70%) and your
carbon dioxide level was high. In the ICU your oxygen and carbon
dioxide level were noted to be better, you were more alert after
wearing the BiPAP mask at night. You were then transferred to
the [**Hospital6 **] Hospital for XRT treatment.

Followup Instructions:
After you are discharged please make an appointment to follow up
with your PCP and Oncologist in [**1-24**] weeks time.

left due to left upper lobe lobectomy. No obvious pneumothorax
has been demonstrated. The post-surgical changes of left ribs
are expected. There is interval decrease in subcutaneous air
collection. Small amount of right pleural effusion is unchanged.

[**2166-2-22**]: One of the two left chest tubes has been removed and
there is no PTX seen.  The residual more medially placed left
chest tube has been pulled back somewhat, with its tip just
above the level of the aortic knob. Subcutaneous emphysema is
identified. Right pleural effusion is seen as was noted
previously. There are some increased interstitial markings but
no new consolidation
[**2166-2-21**]: There is no appreciable left pleural air or fluid. Two
apical pleural tubes unchanged. Mild atelectasis at the base of
the right lung has recurred.
[**2166-2-20**]:Interval worsening in the left apical pneumothorax
without signs
of tension.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male diagnosed Stage III NSCLC in [**9-/2165**] that was
deemed un-resectable prior to chemoRT, s/p chemotherapy x5 and
radiation treatment x16.  He was brought to the OR on [**2-19**] for
thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy, pulmonary artery patch
angioplasty, intercostal muscle flap buttress and mediastinal
lymph node dissection.  During the procedure the left vagus
nerve appeared involved in the tumor and was sacrificed.  ENT
was consulted and found the left TVC to be immobile in the
paramedian position.  The right true vocal fold is WNL and
mobile.  Pt is s/p Gelfoam injection [**2166-2-20**] with good midline
approximation.  Since that time, he has worked with voice
therapy as well as the speech and swallow team and was approved
for a regular diet and has done quite well with respect to PO
intake and strengthening of his voice. His CT was removed on [**2-25**]
and post pull CXR demonstrated no PTX and good lung volumes.
Mr. [**Known lastname 80994**] has worked hard to rehab himself on the floor,
taking several walked each day.  From POD [**2-24**] his O2 requirement

hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p arteriogram, pulmonary arteriogram

1. Rigid bronchoscopy using a black Dumon bronchoscope.
2. Flexible bronchoscopy.
3. Therapeutic aspiration of secretion.


History of Present Illness:
68M ex-smoker diagnosed with
non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2165-9-21**] and
underwent chemotherapy x5 and radiation treatment x16 so far.
The patient suddenly had several episodes of coughing up bright
red blood which totaled about [**11-22**] cups two days ago.  He
presented to the [**Hospital 8641**] hospital ED with a hematocrit of 31.7.
Hematocrit was serially followed and was found to be stable and
was saturating well on room air.  His hemoptysis subsided to
some
extent prior to transfer. A chest CT showed no evidence of
pulmonary embolism, however showed left hilar region mass with
encroachment on left proximal pulmonary artery as well as
proximal upper lobe bronchi.  Pulmonology was consulted and he
felt that the hemoptysis was most likely secondary to his lung
cancer or possibly related to radiation induced bleeding.  He
was
concerned about erosion into the pulmonary artery with potential
for serious bleeding and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.  On admission, patient is breathing comfortably, with
stable vitals.  Patient reports small amount of dark blood
tinged
sputum.  Denies fever, chills, chest pain and SOB.

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2165-12-22**]):    No MRSA isolated.

[**2165-12-20**]: Pulmonary arteriogram was performed showing
unremarkable pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins. The left
pulmonary apex appears to be hypovascular.  Unable to
selectively catheterize the left upper bronchial artery.
CXR:
[**2165-12-20**]:  Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Normal size
of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of focal parenchymal
opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No pneumothorax, no pleural
effusions.
[**2165-12-19**]: 1. Mildly hyperinflated lungs without radiographic
evidence of pneumonia. Increased opacity in the superior pole of
the left hilum.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o male with COPD, Depression, Anxiety, recently diagnosed
with NSCLC IIIa, s/p Chemo and X-RT, admitted for non-massive
hemoptysis on [**2165-12-19**]. CTA negative for PE with LUL mass
encasing pulmonary artery. No evidence of endobronchial
obstruction.  Interventional pulmonology performed a rigid
bronchoscopy and found normal upper airway. Flexible
bronchoscopy was used to assess more distal airway.  They
encountered a blood clot in apical posterior segment of the left
upper lobe.  For details refer to Operative note.  During the
procedure TEE showed saline bubles in left atrium which
suggested clot communicated with pulmonary vein. Therapeutic
aspiration of secretion were performed at this time.  A
bronchial arteriogram was attempted by IR. However, they were
unable to selectively catheterize the left bronchial artery.
Aortogram was also performed with no signs of bleeding from the
left brachial artery on [**2165-12-19**].  The patient was monitored
overnight in SICU. Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible
intervention.  Thoracic surgery felt that due to the location of
the tumor, surgical resection was not curative.  They
recommended finish neoadjuvent therapy and reassess afterwards.
The following day, IR performed a pulmonary arteriogram on
[**2165-12-20**], which showed unremarkable pulmonary arteries and
pulmonary veins. The left pulmonary apex appeared to be
hypovascular.  However, they were unable to selectively
catheterize the left upper bronchial artery.  The patient
tolerated all procedures and recovered without events.  Patient
did not have any further hemoptysis and vital signs and
hematocrit were stable during this admission.  He was discharged
on [**2165-12-23**] afebrile, vital signs stable, ambulating, tolerating
regular diet and voiding.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male with PMH CLL/SLL found to have enlarging right upper
lobe mass who is transferred for possible tumor debridement.
.
MICU course: IP bronched patient and noted large amount of
probable diffuse lung cancer. Stent was not placed due to tumor
extension almost to RLL and no tumor-free area to stent.
Heme/Onc will plan for tissue targeted chemo-regimen.
Outpatient oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11636**] at [**Hospital3 **].
Pathology from OSH showed squamous cell carcinoma.  He was
extubated on the second day.  He underwent MRI of brain which
showed a left frontal lobe lesion.  Other imaging finding noted
for femur and spine and diffused [**Hospital3 500**] mets.  Also was noted
there was a positive rare yeast in tissue culture from [**1-27**].
He was weaned down O2 and is in process to eval by Onc to get
radiation and chemo.
.
He had pain due to the [**Month/Year (2) 500**] mets which was initially not
controlled by a combination of IV morphine.  This was converted
to oxycodon for breakthrough, standing Oxycontin and Lidoderm
for maintenance.  With this new regimen he had better control.
The pain manangement is a large part of his palliative care.  He
is aware of this diagnosis and will discuss the further plan of
care with his outpatient oncologist.  He elected to follow up
with his prior oncologist and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 20282**] were [**Name (NI) 653**] by the

[**2137-8-5**] CXR :
Expected post-operative progressive changes following left
pneumonectomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38758**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a left pneumonectomy.  He
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable
condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was
well controlled with an epidural catheter.  His IV fluids were
minimized in light of his pneumonectomy.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he was able to maintain
good oxygen saturations and did effective incentive spirometry.
He developed some rapid atrial flutter on post op day #1 and was
treated with Lopressor and eventually diltiazem.  His
electrolytes were  repleted and he soon converted to normal
sinus rhythm where he remained.

His chest tube was removed on post op day #1 and serial chest
xrays thereafter showed a gradual increase in fluid accumulation
and at discharge it was about 1/3rd up.  His room air ambulatory
saturations were 99% and in general room air saturations at rest
or with activity were > 94%.  His left thoracotomy was healing
well.

On post op day # 2 he developed a rash which progressed over the
next few days.  It was on his back, palms of hands and forearms
as well as back of the knees and thighs.  It was vesicular on an
erythematous base, itchy and seemed to be occurring at ""moist ""
areas.  The Dermatology service was consulted and felt it was a
contact dermatitis as opposed to histamine effect.
Triamcinolone was recommended and after 24 hours it started to
recede.  He will continue this treatment for 2 weeks and if his
symptoms get worse, he will call the [**Hospital 2652**] Clinic. The
culprit was never identified.

As he continued to progress well, he was discharged to home on
[**2137-8-6**] with VNA services and will follow up in the Thoracic
Clinic in 2 weeks.

buttress on [**2136-8-3**] without complications. He was extubated
without difficulty in the OR and was admitted to the ICU for
management of atrial fibrillation with sick sinus syndrome. The
rest of Mr. [**Known lastname 20693**] hospital course is described below by
system:

1. Respiratory:
Postoperatively, Mr. [**Known lastname 20692**] was kept on 4L of oxygen by nasal
cannula with O2 sats >95% and was breathing comfortably with
pain control by bupivicaine epidural and dilaudid PCA. Chest
tube had minimal serosanginous ouput with no leak detected. On
POD#2, patient had an episode of desaturation to high 80s on
100% O2. CXR showed complete collapse of left lung. Bronchoscopy
was performed with removal of copious clear mucus plugs from
left mainstem and LUL bronchi. Patient was placed on BIPAP
overnight for improved ventilation. AM CXR on POD#3 showed
re-expansion of lung and patient was started on nebulizer
treatments, with improvement in dyspnea, cough production, and
oxygen saturation. Chest tube was removed on POD#4 without
evidence of pneumothorax on post-pull CXR. Oxygen was gradually
weaned to 2L and patient was transferred to the floor on POD#5.
With chest PT and continued nebs, oxygen was weaned completely
by POD#5 during rest and exertion. Patient was discharged home
on POD#6 with O2 sats >98% on room air and arrangements for VNA
and nebulizer treatments at home.
2. Cardiac:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20693**] newly diagnosed afib was present throughout his
postoperative period. He was started on IV lopressor and
transitioned to po lopressor with dose titrated to keep rate
less than 120. He did not experience any ischemic symptoms
throughout this period. He was started on coumadin on POD#6, as
per his cardiologist, with plans to follow up with his PCP for
coumadin dosing.
3. Endocrine:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20693**] blood glucose was 150-200 in the PACU after
surgery. He was kept on a sliding scale during his hospital
stay. He will follow up with his PCP regarding diabetes work up.

4. Heme/Onc:
Pathology reports are pending on Mr. [**Known lastname 20693**] resected lung
mass. EBL from surgery was 1 liter and patient's hct post-op
trended down to 25.2 from preop of 30. He was transfused 2U
PRBCs with appropriate increase in HCT and Hct on day of
discharge was 32.8.

normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Calcified
tips of papillary muscles. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hyopkinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55-60%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction but overall
preserved ejection fraction. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Grossly normal cavity

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96189**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2103-2-19**] where she underwent a right open thoractomy with right
upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection (see operative report
for full details). She remained intubated postoperatively and
transfered to the ICU. Below is a systems review of her hospital
stay.

Neuro: The patient remained neurologically intact throughout her
stay. Dilaudid IV was used in the immediate postoperative
period, then switched to ibuprofen, tylenol, lidocaine patch and
oxycodone, with prn cyclobenzaprine which was effective in pain
relief.

Pulmonary: The patient was keep intubated postoperatively, and
extubated POD 1. Aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued to
incentive spirometry, ambulation, nebulizers and mucolytics.
Home lasix was continued with spot dosing of IV lasix to
diurese. She had a right chest tube which was discontinued
initially on [**2103-2-24**], however developed increasing pneumothorax,
and subcutaneous air necesitating right pigtail placement with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of interventional pulmonology on [**2103-2-26**]. Leak
continued, therefore a talc 5gram pleurodiesis was done on
[**2103-3-2**]. The chesttube was kept for 48hours on suction. It was
eventually removed on [**2103-3-6**] after successful clamp trial, with
stable right small pneumothorax on postpull film.

CV: The patient went into atrial fibrillation on POD 1 after
extubation. This resolved initially on home dose of nadolol and
IV diltiazem. After transfer to the floor on [**2103-2-22**] she
developed atrial fibrillation [**2103-2-23**]. At this time IV lopressor
was unsuccessfull, therefore she received IV amiodarone 10g load
with oral amio plus nadolol as recommended by cardiology
thereafter. We did consult cardiology who recommended echo and
the above described antiarrhythmic agents. The patient had afib
on [**2-26**], but converted midday and has maintained SR since with
occasional tachycardia with ECG evidence of SR with PAC's. It
was felt she did not need coumadin, but a full strength aspirin
was started. The patient remained hemodynamically stable
throughout. Her nadolol was cut in half on [**2-27**] after acute renal
insufficiency as described below. Echo was done on [**2103-2-26**] and
essentially normal with normal LVEF. She was set up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] in a month for followup and weaning off amiodarone.

Abd: Her diet was advanced and tolerated. Stool softeners were
given to prevent constipation.

Renal: Foley was removed POD 1, but replaced for retention, and
dc'd on [**2-24**], with minimal but adequate urine output. She
required IV lasix for volume overload. Daily weights were
followed. Electrolytes were watched and replaced.
On [**2-27**] the patient's creatinine acutely rose to 2.0 then later
2.2. Renal US was performed and normal. NSAIDS were dc'd and
metformin held. Amiodarone was decreased to [**Hospital1 **] and nadolol home
dosing halved to increase renal perfusion pressures. Urine lytes
were done. She was felt to be dry, therefore a liter of fluid
was given. The patient's creatinine was closely watched and two
days later normalized, with auto diuresing.

Endo: Sliding scale insulin was initially given for
hyperglycemia. Her home metformin was restarted with improved
blood sugars in the low 100's. This was held during her renal
insufficiency, and resumed [**2103-3-1**] with improved glucose. Insulin
sliding scale was utilized as well.

ID: The patient remained afebrile, and CBC trends watched. On
[**2-27**] she spiked w WBC count 23, UA was sent and positive, cipro
was started and continued x 3 days. Urine culture was sent and
final was mixed bacteria consistent with fecal contaminant.
After the cipro started her WBC trended downward. The patient
noted that during past colon infections she has never mounted a
fever.

Proph: SCD's and SQ heparin were given for VTE prophylaxis.

Dispo: Physical therapy evaluation was made. The patient was
deemed appropriate for home with PT. She left with a walker for
stabilization. On [**2103-3-6**] the patient was ambulating with
adequate pain control, with room air saturations of 92-94%. The
patient will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**3-13**] with a chest xray in clinic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96013**] was admitted on [**2105-7-1**] for Left thoracotomy
and left upper lobectomy with repair of left pulmonary artery.
She was transfused 3 Units of PRBC in the OR.  She was extubated
in the operating room, transferred to the SICU for monitoring.
Her pain was managed via an Epidural managed by the acute pain
service.  The chest tubes were to suction, foley to gravity. She
developed chest pain, the ECG had no changes and cardiac enzymes
were negative. Her HCT remained stable at 30.  On POD 1 she
transferred to the floor with good pain control, aggressive

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent diagnosis of
non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA. In addition, she reported increased
respiratory secretions, fevers and chills. At OSH, she was found
to have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent
obstruction so she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent
bronchscopy and stent evaluation. On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid
bronchoscopy and it was found that her y-stent migrated so it
was removed was removed. She was noted to have thrush in her
trachea. She was intubated for the procedure and it was decided
to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
of her PNA.
.
Currently, she has been mildly hypotensive this morning, but is
currently off pressors thought to be secondary to a medication
effect. She is intubated and sedated and appears comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who presented to
OSH with pneumonia she is s/p y-stent removal at [**Hospital1 18**] and is
being transferred to the ICU team for further management as
unable to extubate after stent removal.
.
# Respiratory failure - Per the pulmonary team, the patient was
intubated for airway protection in preparation for her
bronchoscopy and stent removal, new stent could not be placed
[**12-22**] anatomy. Given her substantial pnuemonia she was not able to
be extubated post-procedure. Pt was maintained on mechanical
ventilation in AC mode at ARDSnet settings. Pt required sedation
with midazolam and fentanyl in order to remain synchronous c the
vent. Pt's prognosis was felt to be very poor and family
ultimately felt that pt would not have wanted to remain
intubated and pt was transitioned to CMO on [**2178-8-8**]. Pt was
terminally extubated on [**2178-8-8**]. Her oxygen saturations dropped
precipitously and pt became bradycardic and then asystolic.
Family was at the bedside.
.
# Hypotension - Patient was hypotensive upon arrival to the ICU,
possibly secondary to evolving sepsis versus medication effect,
no evidence of active bleeding. Pt was fluid responsive and did
not require vasopressors. Pt received fluid boluses to maintain
MAP>65. Sedation was also kept at the minimum level required for
pt to be synchronous c ventilator. Pt had been on decadron at
home and then pulsed c hydrocortisone 100 q8h at OSH. Pt was
placed back on decadron (started at 6 TID, home dose 8 [**Hospital1 **]) and
the decadron slowly weaned. Pt was transitioned to CMO on
[**2178-8-8**].
.
# PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL
PNA. Given her home steroid usage, concerned for both typical
pneumonia organisms as well as opportunistic infections. Patient
was noted to have thrush in airway. Pt was initially placed on
zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole and cultures sent from
BAL and [**Date Range **]. The stent was also sent for culture. ID consult
was called and the recommendation was made to switch from
fluconazole to micafungin out of concern for fungal pna. Gram
stain of BAL and also a sputum culture from 2 days later all
showed GNRs and so vancomycin was discontinued and pt
maintainted on zosyn, cipro, micafungin. All meds were
discontinued on [**2178-8-8**] when pt became CMO.
.
# NSCLC - Pt scheduled for q3 week chemotherapy. This was held
in the setting of severe infection.
.
# Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
chemotherapy. All cell counts were trended until she became CMO.
.
# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, famotidine, bowel reg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80151**] was admitted on [**2175-9-13**] for  VATS exploration, left
thoracotomy and left upper lobectomy, thoracic lymphadenectomy,
flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration which was complicated by
staples that had torn out of the distal PA resulting in bleeding
requiring 5 Units packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh
frozen plasma, and 4 liters of crystalloid, and a Phenylephrine
drip intraoperatively. He was transferred to the SICU intubated
on Phenylephrine for further management.  The 2 left chest-tube
were to suction with serosanguinous drainage, a foley and
Bupivacaine Epidural for pain control managed by the acute pain
service.  On POD #1 he was extubated without difficulty, the
pressors were stopped, he was started on beta-blockers for brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation in the 100s-140s. Hydromorphone
was added to the epidural for better pain control. He tolerated
a clear liquid diet which was advanced as tolerated.  On POD #2
the atrial fibrillation increased with episodes of hypotension.
An amiodarone bolus/drip was started with better rate control.
The Phenylephrine was restarted for hypotension while in atrial
fibrillation.  Serial chest x-rays showed decreased left lung
volume consistent with surgery and right lower lobe atelectasis.
On POD #3 he converted to sinus rhythm, the chest-tube was
placed to water-seal without air leak. The left anterior chest
tube was removed Oxygen saturations 98% 2.5 Liter nasal cannula.
A PICC line was placed. The epidural was removed and  his pain
was managed with PO pain medication.  On POD #4 the pressors
were wean off, he transferred to the floor.  The PICC line was
removed secondary to Right basilic vein is thrombosed from the
lower one-third of the upper arm to the antecubital fossa
confirmed by ultrasound.  The remainder chest-tube was removed
with stable small apical pneumothorax. On POD #5 the
beta-blockers were increased for persistent paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  Cardiology recommended aspirin 325 mg daily for
anticoagulation.  He continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to home with VNA.  He will follow-up with Dr.

History of Present Illness:
69F with hx of NSCLC s/p Right pneumonectomy, chemo&radiation
two years ago, admitted to OSH for LLL pneumonia on [**11-5**], found
to have tracheoesophageal fistula on barium swallow and
bronchoscopy, transerred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and sedated for
interventional pulmonology evaluation of tracheoesophageal
fistula.
.
Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital 87965**] Hospital [**11-5**], where
she was treated for CAP with 10 days of levofloxacin, requiring
intubation from [**Date range (1) 87966**].  Her antibiotics were broadened
slowly first with aztreonam ([**11-9**]) then vancomycin ([**11-15**]).
She underwent bronchoscopy [**11-8**], which showed significant
inflammation in the left mainstem bronchus; culture showed rare
yeast. Post-extubation, she required continuous Bipap; she
required reintubation on [**11-15**] due to progressive hypercarbia.
She had been started on vasopressin prior to intubation and was
later started on dopamine as well.  At Midcoast, patient also
had a modified barium swallow which showed barium in the
trachea, but no obvious fistula.  Bronchoscopy confirmed
tracheoesophageal fistula 1cm TEF 5cm from the carina.  While at
Midcoast, she was also noted to have afib and aflutter, but no
known prior history.  An Echo on [**11-8**] showed pulmonary
hypertension and septal hypokinesis, but normal EF. She was
transfered to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center intubated on pressors
dopamine and vasopressin.
.
At [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center, patient had a bronchoscopy with BAL
showing GPCs.  She underwent CT chest on [**11-16**] to rule out PE in
setting of mildly elevated CKMB and trop.  It appears that she
was afebrile throughout her stay at [**Hospital 1727**] Medical.  She was
started on IV doses of digoxin for her afib which helped keep
her rate-controlled and noted to be maintained in sinus rhythm.
Patient was on insulin drip at outside hospital for
hyperglycemia in the setting of TPN and high dose stress IV
steroids.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient is on Vancomycin
(Day#4), Clindamycin (Day#3),  Aztreonam (Day#10), Fluconazole
(Day#2).
.
On arrival to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**], patient is intermittently in
stable VT with SBPs in 180s, completely asymptomatic,
intermittently in rapid Afib with rates to 160s.  She was given
one dose of IV metoprolol 5mg while in Afib with RVR which
decreased her HRs and let her self-convert to NSR with rate 80s.

infiltrate mixed with barium
.
EKG:
- [**2131-11-19**] - 19:06 - wide complex tachycardia, rate 143,
evidence of p-waves though diff morphologies and not necessarily
conducting; a capture beat
- [**2131-11-19**] - 19:28 - Afib w RVR, rate 130s; narrow complex;

[**11-18**] CXR:
Rightward mediastinal shift and opacification of the right
hemithorax is
consistent with prior pneumonectomy. There is no gas in the
right
pneumonectomy space. Heterogeneous opacification at the base of
the left lung
could be dependent edema or pneumonia, including aspiration. A
2-cm wide
elliptical opacity projecting over the left mid lung could be a
nodule or
fissural pleural fluid since there is pleural fluid, more
inferiorly.
Mediastinum shifted into the opacified right hemithorax cannot
be assessed.
ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube should be
advanced at least 4
cm to move all the side ports well beyond the gastroesophageal
junction
.
CT Torso:
IMPRESSION:

1. Right pneumonectomy, with no evidence of cancer recurrence.

2. Left lower lobe consolidation, with high-attenuation material
suspicious
for prior aspiration of enteric contrast material.

3. No CT evidence of tracheoesophageal fistula. Please note that
this
examination was not a dedicated trachea study but no
spontaneously patent wall
defect is appreciated.

4. Volume overload as evidenced by pleural effusions, mesenteric
edema,
ascites, and anasarca.
.
MRI Brain:
IMPRESSIONS:

1. No intracranial metastases.

2. Small amount of fluid in right mastoid air cells.

3. Mild chronic small vessel ischemic change.


Brief Hospital Course:
69F with hx NSCLC s/p right pneumonectomy/chemo/radiation who
presented to OSH with LLL pneumonia on [**11-5**], found to have
tracheoesophageal fistula by bronchoscopy, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management of TEF.
.
# Hypercarbic and Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Pt was
transferred from OSH s/p intubation and antibiotic course for
pneumonia. She was transferred after discovery of TE fistula. Pt
remained intubated in the MICU for malignancy w/u and IP
evaluation of the TE fistual. She was taken to the OR on [**11-20**]
for rigid bronch, and while they were there the ET tube was
changed due to cuffleak with resulting ABG showing improvement
in oxygenation and a decrease in her previously elevated CO2.
.
# LLL Pneumonia: CXR showed LLL process; pt had completed 10
days of antibiotics for pneumonia. Vancomycin was continued for
a recent OSH sputum culture that had grown GPCs.  On HD#3,
bilious contents were aspirated from the patient's ET tube. She
was taken to the OR by interventional pulmonology for the
fistula on [**11-20**] (see below for results).  As she was
hemodynamically unstable after the procedure, antibiotics were
broadened on [**11-20**] to vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin.
.
# TE Fistula: The patient had an initial bronchoscopy in the ICU
on HD#2 that showed a well-demarcated fistula. This was thought
to be [**12-26**] trauma from prior intubation or cancer recurrence.
Malignancy w/u was initiated. CT Torso and MRI brain were
negative for evidence of cancer. On HD#3, pt was taken to the OR
for rigid bronch which showed large incision-shaped TEF in trach
into esophagus (thought to be from an intubation through
necrotic tissue); tracheal stent was placed to seal TEF from
tracheal side, but she will need an esophageal stent as well to
be placed by GI. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-20**] for
the esophageal stent to be placed.  EGD was attempted on [**11-21**]
at which point she became hypotensive after propofol induction
and the procedure was stopped.  EGD was delayed until [**11-24**] at
which point the TEF was deemed to be too large and a stent
seemed futile.
.
# Wide Complex Tachycardia: On arrival, pt was in stable VT with
rates in the 140s-150s. Potentially may also have represented
SVT with aberancy, though cards was informally c/s'd and agreed
the rhythm appeared to be stable VT. The patient was given 5 mg
IV metoprolol with conversion into sinus rhythm. An EKG showed
worsening TWI. Cards recs did not feel it was ischemic and that
her persistent narrow complex tachycarida was likely MAT. Her
Lopressor was increased to 5IV q4h on [**11-19**].
.
# Coffee Ground Material in NG tube: On transfer, there was
coffee ground material in the NG tube. Aspirate was guaiac
positive. GI bleed was thought to be [**12-26**] high dose steroids at
OSH. She was maintained on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. Hematocrit remained stable
and no other coffee ground material was seen.
.
# Afib with RVR: Pt was intermittently in Afib with RVR and MAT
along with the wide-complex rhythm discussed above. Metoprolol
was increased to 5 mg IV q4h with good effect. She was
maintained on subQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

# Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient is s/p Right
pneumonectomy ~[**2125-6-24**]
 - s/p chemo ([**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol, fall [**2124**]) and radiation (5040 cGy
EBRT) at [**Hospital1 107**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Kettering. The patient was taken to the
OR on [**11-20**] for TE fistula and biopsies were taken in OR of
tracheal and esophageal sides; necrotic tissue seen in right
bronch stump; biopsy from tracheal side preliminarily shows
possible SCC recurrence, but biopsy from GI side sent in
formalin will take longer to come back
.
# Pt was on pneumoboots and later subQ heparin for DVT
prophylaxis. Communication was with the patient and her husband
[**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 87967**] (home) and ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 87968**] (cell). She remained
full code during this admission.

Trauma ICU Course:
EVENTS:
- [**11-25**]: Transfered to TSICU pre-op for diversion of TEF, SVT to
180's; rate controlled with diltiazem, transiently hypotensive
to 70's but resolved.
- [**11-26**]: OR for TEF diversion c/b migration of stent, interval
enlargement of TEF, drains placed x 3. Respiratory acidosis
resolved with increasing PEEP/rate. Received lasix 10mg for
pulmonary edema.
- [**11-27**]: 2uPRBC's w/ 20 IV lasix between. Weaning vent.
Respiratory distress (on CPAP [**6-30**]) after 1 unit of blood
improved with the lasix. 40 IV lasix total. Increased alkalosis
holding diuresis as FeUrea is high. SVT (130's) at 3 AM, rate
controlled with 10 IV lopressor, increased dilt PO to 60 QID.
- [**11-28**]: 20 lasix, dropped HR to 40s on [**3-27**] CPAP. Placed on 100%
FiO2, [**7-2**]- resolved. diamox given, monitoring diuresis
- [**11-29**]: CPAP 5/0 in AM, 15 minutes, tachycardic, went into a. fib
responsive to IV diltiazem, increased CPAP [**7-4**] throughout day.
Met with family briefly.
- [**11-30**]: family meeting - continue care/full code.
- [**12-1**]: TF's started, continuing TPN until TFs at goal. Metabolic
alkalosis largely resolved, likely contraction alkalosis from
diuresis in setting of baseline compensatory alkalosis; dc'd
diamox and started [**Hospital1 **] lasix. Good diuresis but pt hypotensive -
albumin 12.5g x 2 with improvement. Family requests palliative
care consult. Decreased insulin in TPN given episodes of AM
hypoglycemia
- [**12-2**]: D/c'd lasix for weight < preadmission. Patient made CMO
after extensive conversation with patient, family, palliative
care, nursing; ICU attending present.

The patient expired thereafter.

[**2191-1-2**] - INR 1.2


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10689**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service on
[**2190-12-27**] for left thoracotomy, left upper lobectomy,
decortication, and mediastinal lymph node dissection.  He
tolerated the procedure well and went to the ICU
post-operatively for blood pressure monitoring.  He was
transferred to the floor on POD 2, where he did well.  The
basilar chest tube was removed on POD 4, and the apical chest
tube on POD 5.  He was discharged home on POD 6.

Neuro: Pain was initially well-controlled with an epidural,
which was removed on POD 4.  He began oral pain medications on
POD 4 with good effect.

CV: His blood pressure was low post-operatively, with MAP's in
the 50's, requiring low-dose vasopressors on POD 0-1.  He
received 2 units PRBC's and his pressure improved.  Before
transfer to the floor, his MAP's were consistently in the high
60's without pressors.  His blood pressure remained stable
through the remainder of his admission.

PULM: He underwent a left upper lobectomy with decortication and
mediastinal lymph node dissection, with 2 chest tubes placed in
the OR.  Immediately post-operatively, he had a large, 4-chamber
air leak in both chest tubes.  His air leak decreased daily,
until it was a 1-chamber leak only in the apical tube.  His
basilar chest tube was removed on POD 4, and the apical chest
tube on POD 5.  His chest x-rays consistently showed moderate
expansion of the remaining left lower lobe and left midline
shift.  He was encouraged to use IS and ambulate often.

GI: He was given a regular diet immediately post-operatively,
which he tolerated well.  He did not have any issues with
diarrhea or constipation.

GU: A foley catheter was placed in the OR, and was kept in place
while he had the epidural.  His urine output was monitored.  It
was removed at midnight on POD 5, after the epidural was
removed.

Heme/ID: He required 2 units of PRBC's for low blood pressure
and decreased urine output, to which he responded well.  He did
not require any transfusions after POD 1.  He was given cipro
empirically for possible abscess in the resected specimen.
Cipro was stopped when the cultures from the OR returned
negative. He was begun on coumadin at discharge with
instructions to follow-up immediately with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **].

Prophylaxis: He was given subcutaneous heparin TID and SCD's.
He was encouraged to ambulate early.

At the time of discharge on POD 6, he was ambulating
independently, voiding, and had good pain control with oral pain
medications.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks
and Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] tomorrow.

History of Present Illness:
50y F initially presenting in [**2105-1-18**] w/ a single episode
of hemoptysis, bronchoscopy was performed that demonstrated no
gross lesions but cytology showed some atypical cells. Upon
subsequent follow-up in [**2105-9-20**] a repeat bronchocsopy was
performed, cytology consistent w/ non-small cell carcinoma. A
biopsy was then done which demonstrated poorly differentiated
squamous carcinoma. She has no current complaints of cough,
hemoptysis, or weight loss, but does relay some recent hx of
night sweats. Her history is significant
for Hodgkins lymphoma s/p staging laparotomy, splenectomy w/ no
evidence of infradiaphgramatic disease, s/p radiation as well as

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the TSICU following her operation on
[**2105-12-2**].  The following information covers dates [**12-2**] -
[**12-4**]:

Neuro:  Pain controlled initially with morphine / bupivacaine
epidural per APS with inadequate pain control per patient.
Epidural was split to contain only bupivacaine and the patient
was started on a dilaudid PCA for pain, which improved her pain
control somewhat.  Due to her persistent hypotension, however,
the epidural was d/c'd on POD 2 and she was transitioned to a
dilaudid PCA with PO percocet, tizanidine, toradol, and
gabapentin.  Her pain control did improve each subsequent
hospital day with adjustments to the doses and frequency of
these medications.

CV:  Blood pressure augmented with phenylephrine gtt
postoperatively.  Attempts to wean the pressor on POD 1 were
unsuccessful, likely related to high-dose bupivacaine epidural.
IVF maintained at maintenance rate and gentle albumin bolus
given.  She was weaned from phenylephrine succesfully on POD 2
and remained hemodynamically stable thereafter.

Resp:  Extubated early morning of POD 1, maintaining O2
saturations > 95% on 2L nasal cannula / face tent, then room
air.  Incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet encouraged.
Chest tubes x2 to right chest were maintained to suction for the
first 24 hours postoperatively and then transitioned to
waterseal.  A CXR on POD 1 demonstrated small right pneumothorax
and the chest tubes were placed back to suction.  On POD 2 the
chest tubes were again placed to waterseal and did demonstrate a
persistent but stable small air leak.

Chest tubes:On POD 2 the chest tubes remained on water.  The
apical chest tube was removed.  The CXR showed slight increase
in apical pneumothorax and a hydropneumothorax.  She remained on
water-seal. Followed by serial chest films.  On POD8 the basilar
chest-tube was clamped x 24 hrs, CXR showed stable pneumothorax.
On POD9 the basilar chest-tube was removed follow-up CXR showed
a stable PTX.

GI:  Diet started with clear liquids and advanced to regular on
POD 1.

GU:  Foley catheter remained in place while epidural was needed.
Once removed she voided without difficulty

Heme: Hematocrit remained stable postoperatively, no need for
blood product transfusions.

ID:  Perioperative ancef given x3 doses total, then d/c'd.

Endo:  No issues

Disposition: she was discharged to home on POD 9 and will
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
