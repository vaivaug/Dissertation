Chief Complaint:
S/p L mainstem bronchus stent removal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with stent removal
Intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
71yo F with a history of stage IIIa non-small lung [**Hospital 4699**]
transferred to the MICU after rigid bronch for observation. The
patient was diagnosed with lung cancer in 4/00 and is now s/p
RUL lobectomy, carboplatin tx, and radiation tx. Since then, she
has had multiple bronchoscopies, including placement of a stent
into the L main bronchus in [**4-1**]. On [**8-20**], she had a
bronchoscopy which revealed significant narrowing of L main
bronchus with formation of granulation tissue. She underwent
rigid bronchoscopy on the day of admission ([**2189-9-4**]) showing
almost 95 percent obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. She
was treated with stent removal, debridement of a large amount of
granulation tissue, and argon laser coagulation.
The patient was felt to be at risk for airway collapse and
bleeding after the procedure, and was not extubated. She was
transferred to the MICU from the PACU for further monitoring and
evaluation.

Past Medical History:
1. Right upper lobe lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, stage III). In
[**4-/2185**], right wedge biopsy - adenocarcinoma. In 04/00, right
upper lobe lobectomy. Positive hilar/paratracheal node
involvement.
2. Hypothyroid.
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Right arm surgery (? years ago, broken arm, unable to set,
metal plates and screws, patient states that she has had
numerous MRIs since the surgery)


Social History:
The patient is married, graduated from [**University/College 4700**]. No
ethanol use, denies any tobacco use. She has three children,
former bookkeeper/accountant.
Supportive and involved husband.

LEFT ARM FILM:
Pathologic fracture of the proximal humerus as described above.
A large lytic lesion is present involving the humeral head and
proximal humerus. This is concerning for metastatic disease.
Taking into account the recent chest x-ray that did not
demonstrate evidence of malignancy, this is concerning for
metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma and abdominal CT is
recommended for further evaluation.

CHEST CT:
1. 2.6 x 2.4 cm left lower lobe lesion, likely lung carcinoma.
This lesion would be amenable to a CT-guided biopsy if
clinically desired.

2. Extensive pleural thickening and calcification likely from
asbestos exposure.

3. Rounded pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe, suspicious
for metastasis.

4. Bony destruction of T9 and T10 vertebrae with tumor extension
into the bony spinal canal. There is a high risk for compression
fracture in the future given the extent of these lesions.

5. Two suspicious enhancing areas within the right lobe of the
liver raise the question of metastases, though the appearance is
not typical.

6. Likely bilateral renal cysts, incompletely characterized.

7. Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the distal aspect of the
abdominal aorta. Left common iliac artery aneurysm. Roughly 50%
stenosis of the right superficial femoral artery. Bilateral
atrial enlargement.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESP:  Initially, pt admitted to floor for workup of
malignancy.  However, on day#1, he developed increasing
agitation.  He was not clearing secretions and was intubated for
airway protection.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Pt was in
ICU for about 6 days.  As his agitation and myoclonuse improved,
he was extubated, and then transferred back to floor.
.
2) HUMERUS FRACTURE:  AS this represented likely pathologic
fracture, a needle biopsy was done.  Pt also had malignancy w/u
with torso CT.  This showed lung masses and abdominal mets.  The
pathology from humerus revealed likely metastatic lung
carcinoma.  Pt was seen by ortho onc but was not a surgical
candidate.
.
3) ONC:  Pt was seen by onc, rad onc, neurosurg, and ortho onc
regarding likely lung CA with mets to bone including spine.
However, based on discussions with family, pt was made CMO given
very poor prognosis.  A few days after this change, on [**9-13**], the
pt was found unresponsive and pronounced dead at 7:15AM.  The
family was called and declined autopsy.
.
4) CV:  His CAD, CHF, afib were not active issues during this
hospitalization.  EP service was consulted to turn off ICD given
pt made CMO, however, this was not completed as there was
concern that the family did not want to tell pt this was to be
done.

[**1-30**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Since the previous tracing of [**2184-1-22**] atrial
fibrillation is a new rhythm. The rate is more rapid. There are
non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities which may be due in part,
to the more rapid rate.

[**1-30**] CXR: The right internal jugular central venous catheter
terminates in the proximal superior vena cava. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal and stable. There is increased prominence of the
pulmonary hila and outlining of the right major fissure
consistent with volume overload/mild congestive heart failure.
The lung fields again show right lower lobe airspace
consolidation consistent with pneumonia. There is no pleural
effusion.

[**2-2**] CXR: Previous right middle and lower lobe collapse have
nearly resolved. Moderate right pleural effusion and some
consolidation in the lower lobe persist. Lung volumes are
generally larger and there has been an improvement in
subsegmental atelectasis at the left base also. Upper lungs are
clear. Heart is top normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Tip
of the right jugular line projects over the mid SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation admitted
for PNA and severe sepsis.

1) Sepsis due to pneumonia: The patient was initially admitted
to the intensive care unit where he was volume resuscitated,
treated with ceftriaxone/levofloxacin, weaned off levephed, and
gradually titrated off oxygen.  He was initially on stress dose
steroids, which were subsequently discontinued when his cortisol
level returned elevated. He was transferred to the general floor
[**2184-2-3**]. At time of discharge he was 95% on room air, 93% with
ambulation. He was discharged to complete a 14 day course of
cefpodoxime/azithromycin.

2) Atrial fibrillation: The patient had multiple paroxysmal
episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR. The electrophysiology
service was consulted, and he was started on flecanide in
addition to the metoprolol. He was not anticoagulated, given his
history of falls. At time of discharge, he was in sinus rhythm
with good rate control. He was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor to follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

3) Thrombocytopenia: Over the course of his hospital stay, his
platelets nadired at 82, subsequently rising to 132 on
discharge. A HIT antibody was negative and the patient was
without evidence of bleeding. His thrombocytopenia was most
likely related to sepsis-related bone marrow suppression; his
platelet count will need to be monitored as an outpatient.

4) Bipolar disorder: The patient was continued on Topamax,
zyprexa, and depakote.

5) Anemia: Per notes, the patient has received IV iron in the
past. Vitamin B12/folate were normal, and iron studies were
consistent with anemia of acute inflammation. At time of
discharge, his hematocrit was stable at 33. His hematocrit will
need to be closely monitored as an outpatient; outpatient
colonoscopy may be considered at the discretion of his PCP.

Social History:

Family History:
NC

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, he was initially hypotensive (70s/40s) and
bradycardic (50s). He was treated as a beta-blocker overdose and
given IVF (~2L NS) and glucagon, with improvement in his
hemodynamics. He had a CXR, CTA and CT torso, all of which were
unrevealing.
.
He recieved empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole
500 mg IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV and vancomycin 1 g IV) and was
transferred to the medical floor. On the floor, he developed
rigors, fevers to 104.1 with tachycardia to the 110s and
hypoxemia to 88% on RA. There was no witnessed aspiration event,
although the pt does have a h/o aspiration for which he was
treated at an OSH.  He received a dose of diazepam for possible
EtOH withdrawal that had no immediate effect. Of note, the pt
did receive a pneumococcal vaccination on the day prior to
admission.
.
On transfer to the ICU, the pt reported feeling well. He denied
shortness of breath, and reported that the arm pain that he
presented with had gotten better. He denies lightheadedness,
neck stiffness, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, abdominal
pain, dysuria.
.
ICU COURSE;
Fever hypotension/Shock: Given the pt's history of aspiration,
considered aspiration pneumonitis. Although he did not have a
witnessed aspiration event, his wife reports a nearly identical
admission ~2 years ago. Also in the differential were pulmonary
embolism, an intrabdominal source of infection with associated
sepsis, a reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine-which
chronologically fits well with the story/cytokine like effect,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome. PE is
unlikely given his normal CTA. An intrabdominal infection is
unlikely given his normal CT scan and abdominal exam. A reaction
to the pneumococcal vaccine is the most likely factor at this
point as there is no signs of infection/endocrine phenomenon.
His CK is not elevated, and he is not rigid on exam, making NMS
unlikely. He is, if anything, hyporeflexive, making serotonin
syndrome unlikely.  As his hypotension was accompanied by
bradycardia it is felt likely that an etiology could be beta
blocker overdose (not felt to be intentional).
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was negative, no growth from his cultres at 48
hours.  TSH was normal.  An EKG showed 1st degree AVB.  He was
given IV fluids, stress dose steroids, vanco/levo/flagyl for
broad empiric coverage and pan cultured.
A CXR on [**7-8**] showed ?LLL infitlrate vs atelectasis.  Diuresis
with 10mg IV lasix was performed and a PA and LAT were done
after diuresis that showed a retrocardiac density, no overload
but clinical suspicion of pneumonia was low.
An echo did not show any vegetations.
Pneumovax was added to his allergy list.
.
#hypoxemia-Pt had 02 req of 2-3L prior to transfer. He did not
have symptoms such as cough/SOB/wheeze. Pt was given aggressive
hydration on admission for hypotension. Resultant CXR showed
this as well as crackles on exam.  He autodiuresed once his BP
had improved and his CXR showed improvement in hilar edema.
However  there was question of LLL infiltrate on CXR [**7-8**] and
persistent 3L NC O2 requirement.  Vanco was discontinued and
levo/flagyl was continued until diuresis and repeat PA and LAT
to assess LLL, CXR showed a left retrocardiac density (pna vs
atelectasis)-however he no longer had an oxygen requirement even
with ambulation.  He will follow up with his PCP.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of alcohol abuse


Discharge Condition:
stable, afebrile, BP 120/77, 94%ra, HR 61, ambulatory


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with symptoms of weakness, you had low blood
pressure and a slow heart rate.  You had imaging of your head,
chest, and abdomen without evidence of infection or blood clot
in your lungs.  You received antibiotics as infection was
suspected.  You had no evidence of a problem with your adrenal
glands, or thyroid.  It is believed that your low blood pressure
was due to a reaction from your pneumovax that was given the day
before.  Also, since your heart rate was low it is possible that
this was due to a high dose of beta blocker.
In addition you had two episodes of fecal incontinence which you
have had in the past when you are not home.  Your rectal exam
was normal. If this does not improve when you go home you need
to seek medical attention. You have been given a prescription
for a bedside commode.
You should continue taking your medications as prescribed. You
should not take your metoprolol until you follow up with with
your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Please seek medical attention for chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, weakness, dizzyness, or any other
concerning symptoms.
It is very important that you follow up as outlined below.

Chief Complaint:
Mental Status Changes/Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old male with hepatitis C, history of alcohol
abuse, bipolar affective disorder, atrial fibrillation, and a
recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia who was transferred from
an outside hospital where he had presented with mental status
changes and dyspnea.   The patient was not able to give a full
account of the circumstances leading to his admission, but per
his family he had increasing dyspnea and confusion starting
approximately five days prior to presentation.  He may have had
chills but no fevers and he was noted to be extremely fatigued.
At the outside hospital he was febrile, bradycardic,
hypotensive, non-verbal, pale, and not following commands
reliably.  After initial lab results did not reveal a clear
source of his illness he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 100, BP 89/40, HR 45, RR
16, 94% on 2L. Over his ED course he became progressively more
hypoxic and eventually required 4.5L of O2 by nasal cannula to
maintain a sat of 92%.  He was initially bradycardic with rates
in the 40's but this spontaneously improved to 70s-90s without
interventions.  His SBP's improved to 90's-100's with 2L IVF.
His chest radiograph revealed a right middle lobe infiltrate,
which he had recently been treated for at [**Hospital1 18**] (admission until
[**2186-5-10**]).  He received vancomycin and levofloxacin for a
possible pulmonary infection as well as IV metronidazole as the
patient had diarrhea and had C diff in [**Month (only) 958**].  He was
transferred to the ICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
- Atrial Fibrillation
- History of clostridium difficile
- Bipolar Affective Disorder
- History of hepatitis C
- History of rheumatic heart disease
- History of right middle cerebral artery aneurysm clipped in
[**2167**] at [**Hospital6 1708**]
- History of pernicious anemia
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Social History:
He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has a history of alcohol abuse but
this was greater than twenty years ago.  He stopped smoking
after his previous hospitalization (about one month prior to
presentation) but previously had a 40 pack year history.  He had
been discharged from his last hospitalization with oxygen but
had not been using this prior to admission.

Family History:
His father had lung cancer and his mother had congestive heart
failure.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG on Presentation: sinus at 72 with frequent PACs, nl axis, nl
intervals, no ischemic changes; prior was afib with rvr, but
otherwise unchanged

Portable Chest Radiograph [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent unexplained dense consolidation and
volume loss
of the right middle lobe.

CT Head [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2186-6-14**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
-Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-5-3**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly
higher.

Liver/Gallbladder Ultrasound [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No focal liver lesions. No ascites.

Abdomen Radiograph [**2186-6-14**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2186-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent severe consolidation in the right middle lobe,
showing improved aeration, but no bronchial obstruction,
probably inadequately treated pneumonia.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, small on the right, very small on
the left,
improved since [**5-4**], and lymphatic engorgement in the upper
lungs,
probably indication of cardiac dysfunction as well as volume
overload.
Probable calcific aortic stenosis.
3. Stigmata of cirrhosis, not fully evaluated on this study.

CT Head W/O Contrast [**2186-6-16**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality seen.

EEG [**2186-6-17**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG recording due to the
slow
and disorganized pattern, the left anterior temporal lower
amplitude
recording and the right temporal intermittent focal slowing. The
first
abnormality suggests widespread mild encephalopathy of a
metabolic,
ischemic, or medication etiology. The second abnormality
suggests a
cerebral or extra-cerebral abnormality interfering with the
voltage of
the recording such as a hematoma or severe cortical abnormality.
The
last abnormality suggests a subcortical dysfunction in the right
temporal area. Of note was the atrial fibrillation. If capturing
discrete episodes of unconsciousness or unresponsiveness is the
main
objective of this study, a more prolonged EEG telemetry should
be
considered.

Chest Radiograph [**2186-6-18**]:
FINDINGS: Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are
flattened, consistent with COPD. Compared with [**2186-6-14**], there is
a new small right pleural effusion extending into the minor
fissure. Again seen is patchy opacity at the right base,
consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. No CHF. The right
mid and upper zones of the left lung remain grossly clear. No
gross left-sided effusion. Asymmetric pleural thickening is
noted at the right lung apex.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with cirrhosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
history of tobacco abuse and recent pneumonia presenting with
dyspnea, fevers, and mental status changes.

1) Altered mental status: At presentation the patient was
minimally responsive and seemed quite somnolent.  As he was
started on treatment for presumed infection and hydrated his
mental status improved so that later in the day on [**2186-6-14**] (the
patient was admitted overnight) his family thought his ability
to answer questions and participate with conversation was near
his baseline though his responses were still delayed.  The
patient continued to have a rather odd affect and answered
questions with brief, simple responses but he was alert and
oriented*3 and could answer questions in an appropriate manner.
He maintained minimal insight, however, into the the
circumstances of his hospitalization or his health in general.
On [**2186-6-16**] the patient was noted to have a decompensation where
he would transiently have periods of staring into space and
becoming less responsive for seconds at at time.  Between these
episodes he appeared in his normal state of alertness.  He was
evaluated by neurology, had a second head CT (that remained
without acute changes), and had an essentially benign lumbar
puncture.  EEG on [**2186-6-17**] revealed a diffuse slowing pattern
consistent with unclear encephalopathy but was negative for
epileptiform activity.  Neurology also considered a diagnosis of
parkinsomism being responsible for his delayed responses and
somewhat labored speech perhaps worsened by his chronic
anti-psychotic drug therapy.  Nevertheless, as the patient was
switched to a different pneumonia regimen (see below) and
generally improved back to his baseline the suspicion was that
the patient had intermittent toxic-metabolic delirium due to his
presumed pneumonia that improved with treatment of his
infection.  B12 levels and TSH levels were also checked to rule
out reversible causes of delirium and were normal. At time of
discharge, the patient's wife thought his mental status was at
his baseline.

2) Pneumonia: At presentation the patient had a persistent
infiltrate consistent with unresolved pneumonia.  Further
imaging including CT chest were consistent with this.  The
patient initially received pipercillin-tazobactam and vancomycin
in the ICU but this was switched to levofloxacin and vancomycin
on his first full day in the hospital as despite his pneumonia
his presentation seemed less consistent with sepsis and this was
thought unlikely to be hospital-associated pneumonia as it had
been over a month since his previous discharge.  His respiratory
symptoms improved somewhat though he continued to get
asymptomatically hypoxic to the high 80's on room air and even
at the time of discharge required 2-3L O2 by nasal cannula to
maintain O2 sats >92%.  He also continued to spike fevers.  On
[**2186-6-17**] he was switched from levofloxacin to pipercillin
tazobactam with eventual resolution of his fevers.  His
persistent hypoxia was thought most likely consistent with
resolving pneumonia in the context of his underlying lung
disease (COPD).  He was discharged to finish an additional seven
days of pipercillin-tazobactam therapy (for a total of ten days
on this antibiotic).  Given concern for his mental status and
aspiration a repeat speech and swallow evaluation was performed
and consistent with the results of the last such evaluation
during his previous hospitalization he was not observed to be
aspirating.

3) Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive at presentation but
this resolved with fluid boluses and never recurred.
Presumably, this initial hypotension was due to volume depletion
in the context of decreased PO intake in the context of illness
and increased insensible losses due to fever.

4) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On presentation the patient
was bradycardic but this resolved without intervention.  He then
became tachycardic with Afib with RVR to rates in the 120's.  He
was restarted on his home flecainide dose with better rates.  He
was also continued on his home aspirin (he is not on coumadin as
he has been considered a fall risk).  Eventually, low dose beta
blocker was added for additive rate control.

6) Cytopenias: The patient has chronic anemia and
thrombocytopenia that were essentially stable during his
hospital course.  Given his history of pernicious anemia and
lack of B12 supplementation B12 level was checked and was
supra-normal (folate level was also normal). He has had past
hematologic work up for this problem without a clear source
identified though he is on multiple medications (valproate,
flecainide) that can cause marrow suppression and he also had
signs of cirrhosis on imaging, which can lead to cytopenias due
to sequestration.  Once hemolysis was ruled out by smear and
labs and has his counts remained stable further work up was
deferred in the context of his more acute issues.

7) Bipolar Affective Disorder: The patient was continued on his
home doses of valproate and olanzapine with stable affect.

8)Cirrhosis: Imaging findings on his CT exam were consistent
with cirrhosis and previous notes mention a history of hepatitis
C though he has had negative antibody tests in the past
(antibodies to Hep B have also been negative).  Possible
etiologies could include past alcohol use vs Non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis vs cryptogenic cirrhosis.  As there were no
signs of acute decompensation this issue was deferred to
outpatient management and he was set up for outpatient follow up
in hepatology clinic.

9) Recent fall:  The patient had a recent fall leading to
abrasions on his lower extremities.  These were cared for with
local measures.  PT evaluation suggested the patient would need
near constant assistance and recommended acute rehab.  He and
his wife expressed a preference for being sent home with
multiple services including home PT and this was set up prior to
discharge.

The patient was fed a full, cardiac diet.  He was full code.

Discharge Condition:
All vital signs stable, Mental status back to baseline. 96% on
3L via nasal cannula. Afebrile x 24 hours.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for altered mental status and trouble
breathing.  Ultimately, we think this was due to your pneumonia
recurring.  We gave you antibiotics to treat your pneumonia but
because your mental status remained a bit worse than normal we
also did scans of your head and a lumbar puncture to make sure
you didn't have infection or bleeding.  Your studies did not
show these.  You are being discharged to finish recovering from
pneumonia.

Your medications have been changed.  Please take your
medications as prescribed.

Please come to your local ED or call your doctor if you have
worsening of your breathing, chest pain, fevers, chills,
shortness of breath, or any other concerning changes in your

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 66-yo man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
hepatitis C, h/o C.diff colitis, and a recent pneumonia,
discharged [**2186-6-21**] on Vanc / Zosyn, who was found by his family
to be more hypoxic and tired than usual so they brought him into
the ED. His wife found him to be more sick than usual at about
4pm today, needing more supplemental O2 than prior (2L -->
3-4L), feeling warm and looking [**Doctor Last Name 352**]. She called EMS, who
brought him in to the ED today.
.
On arrival in the ED, VS - Temp 101.4F, 148/78, HR 98, R 28,
SaO2 99% NRB. He received Tylenol 650mg PR x2. Blood Cx sent x2,
UA negative. He was initially weaned down to 4L NC, but
desaturated to the 80s so was re-started on the NRB with
improvement to the mid-90s. Lactate was 2.6 and CXR showed a
possible right basilar pneumonia and a coiled PICC line. He
subsequently became hypotensive to the high-70s but was fluid
responsive. His PICC line was pulled and sent for Cx and a RIJ
CVL was placed, and he got 4L NS IVF with SBPs 95-100. ID was
curbsided regarding Abx coverage, and he received Vancomycin,
Meropenem, and Tobramycin for broad coverage. He is admitted to
the MICU for sepsis. He did not require any vasopressor support.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he feels well and has no complaints. He
acknowledges fever but denies SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, diarrhea, or swelling.

[**2186-7-3**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-1**], there is some
increasing
opacification at the right base medially with silhouetting of
the
hemidiaphragm, consistent with right middle lobe consolidation.
Mild
atelectatic changes at the left base with blunting of the
costophrenic angle persist. Upper lung zones remain clear.
.
[**6-23**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion.
1. Possible right basilar pneumonia. Recommend repeat radiograph
of the chest to confirm with more optimized technique.
2. Interval slight retraction of the right PICC which is looped
in the right subclavian vein.
.
[**2186-6-26**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened/deformed. No discrete vegetation is seen, but cannot
be excluded due to suboptimal image quality and diffuse aortic
valve thickening. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-6-14**],
the findings are similar.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2184**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
[**6-27**] Video swallow
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe oral and mild pharyngeal
dysphagia resulting in penetration and aspiration due to
premature spillover, delayed swallow initiation, and mildly
reduced laryngeal valve closure.
.
[**6-27**] CT head
NONCONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, edema, mass
effect, or evidence of acute infarct.
Evidence of previous right pterional craniotomy and vascular
clip in the right ICA are unchanged since [**2186-6-16**].
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity
represent chronic microvascular infarction, unchanged since
[**2186-6-16**]. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**6-27**] LE U/S
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT,
although there is limited visualization of the calf veins
bilaterally.
.
[**6-28**] CT Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right middle lobe consolidation with interval increase
in right
middle lobe volume loss without evidence of endobronchial
lesion. Several
enlarged and numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes not
significantly
changed from the prior study and likely reactive in nature.
2. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions right
greater than left.
3. Multiple bilateral 3-6 mm nodules, unchanged compared to the
prior study.
A followup CT is recommended in one year to ensure two-year
stability.
4. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 66M with a history of pAF, c.diff colitis,
recent pneumonia, admitted to the ICU with recurrent PNA/sepsis
and found to have RML/RLL PNA & and being empirically tx for c
diff colitis.
.
# Pneumonia: The patient was admitted with high fever, hypoxia,
and hypotension. His CXR showed evidence of a RML/RLL pneumonia
thought to be due to aspiration given dysphagia on swallow
study. He was treated with a 14 day course of meropenem which
was completed today.  He does have pleural effusions but no
thoracentesis was done given that it was difficult to position
the patient and there was not enough fluid to safely tap. He was
gently diuresed during his admission. His CT scan showed
pulmonary nodules that need to be followed up as an outpatint.
Given his repeated pneumonias checked HIV Ab and IgG both
unremarkable.  His b-glucan came back at >500 pg/mL.  Given his
clinical improvement and no known reason for immunocompromise he
was not treated for a fungal infection.  This lab should be
redrawn in [**4-19**] weeks after discharge to ensure that it improves.
 A galactomannan was drawn while he was in the ICU and should be
followed up as an outpatint.  He was placed on a dysphagia diet
given concern for repeat aspiration PNA and failure of swallow
study.  He required 3L of oxygen at the time of discharge (he
had 2L oxygen requirement prior to admisison).
.
# Fever/ Sepsis: Pt has septic physiology in the ED and MICU.
She grew gram + cocci in clusters in 1 bottle anaerobic from
[**2186-7-2**] and was started on vancomycin IV which she received for
one day until it came back coag negative staph. His last fever
was [**2186-7-3**].  All other blood cx have been negative. His urine
cx was negative (except for [**Female First Name (un) **]).  His fever/sepsis was
treated with a 14 day course of meropenem as detailed above
under the PNA section.
.
# Diarrhea: The patient had diarrhea while in the ICU.  He was
empirically treatment for c.diff although he was c diff negative
x3 during this hospitalizatoin. He had 5 BM the day prior to
discharge some of which were loose stools.  Given his completion
of meropenem on [**2186-7-6**] the patient will be given an additional
7 day course of flagyl with the last dose the eveing of [**2186-7-13**].
 His diarrhea may not be c diff in origin and could just be due
to his meropenem.
.
# Anisicoria: Anisicoria was noticed on exam with R eye dilated
more than left.  This is an old finding for the patient as he
has a PCOM aneurysm compressing CN III.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is being continued
on his home dose of Flecainide and Digoxin.  His metoprolol was
decreased to [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-1**] given occassional low HR and at times
his metoprolol still needs to be held for decreased BP.  He is
being continued on aspirin. Per a discussion the ICU team had
with his PCP and cardiology he is not being anticoagulation
given his history of falls.  On the medicine floor he did not
have a fib with RVR, however, he is at higher risk for RVR given
that he was started on ritalin. However, given his decreased
affect and the positive effect of ritalin on his energy level we
have continued the ritalin.
.
#Anemia: His HCT has been stable at approximately 30.  The
anemia is macrocytic and likely from liver disease. His recent
B12/Folate were within normal limits.  His ferrous sulfate
supplement should be continued.
.
# Psych: The patient has bipolar disorder and has been stable on
Depakote for several years with no recent changes. In the ICU
there was concern for somnolence and his flat affect and his
Zyprexa was discontinued. Given his decreased energy level he
was started on ritalin ([**2186-6-30**]) which he has responded to.  His
outpatient psychiatrist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] is aware of these changes.  I
spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] about our concern for his depression and he
was started on citalopram 20mg daily ([**2186-7-3**]) which should be
increased to 30mg daily (on [**2186-7-10**]) if he does well on it.
Given his history of bipolar disorder he needs to be closely
monitored for symptoms of mania since his zyprexa was stopped
and citalopram was started. He varied from A & O x2 to 3.  He
does not always participate when asked date. His mental status
can wax and wanes sometimes with the patient not always
answering questions in an appropriate time frame especially in
evening.  His affect is flat and his thinking is very slow.
.
Severe dry eyes and keratitis: also saw the patient and found
severe dry eyes and keratitis of the right eye.  Continue
aritifical tears.
.
# ? Liver disease: There is concern for liver disease given AP
408, AST 89, INR 1.4, and mild thrombocytopenia.  He was Hep C
Ab neg. His Hep B serologies were consistent with prior
infection (surface and core Ab+). He hoes have a remote history
of heavy alcohol use.  He needs outpatient liver follow up after
he leaves rehab.
.
# Bradycardia/Hypotension: he had a few short episodes of
bradycardia and hypotension on arrival to ED which resolved.  He
has some low BPs in the ICU. He also had some SBP in the high
80s/low 90s while on the medicine floor and he was
assymptomatic.
.
# Nutrition: He is on a dysphagia diet: PO diet nectar thick
liquids, soft solids, and pills whole with puree or nectar thick
liquid.  He aspirated liquids when he takes large sips. At rehab
he can take small sips of regular liquids between meals if he is
undersupervison.  He still has severe LE edema which is likely
influenced by poor nutrition.
.
# Prophylaxis:
-DVT: heparin sc. No anticoagulation for A fib (see above)
-Stress ulcer: H2 blocker
.
# Code status: Full code

[**2186-8-7**] Abdominal CT:IMPRESSION: Wall thickening in the
descending and sigmoid colon, including
the rectum with mesenteric stranding consistent with colitis.
Interval
increase in large amount of free intra- abdominal and mesenteric
fluid.

[**2186-8-10**] Renal Ultrasound :
CONCLUSION: No evidence of renal abnormalities. Large volume of
ascites
noted.

[**2186-8-17**] Abdominal CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased size of bilateral simple pleural effusions with
increased
bibasilar dependent atelectatic changes.
2. Large volume abdominal pelvic ascites which appears grossly
stable.
3. Evaluation of bowel loops is limited by lack of IV and oral
contrast.
Given this limitation, there is no evidence for obstruction or
bowel
perforation.
4. Shrunken liver with nodular contour. Status post
cholecystectomy.
5. 4mm left pulmonary nodule. Per Fleichner society guidelines,
recommend
[**7-28**] month follow up chest CT if patient has risk factors for
pulmonary
malignancy.

[**2186-8-23**] Abdominal CT:
IMPRESSION:
  1. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

2. Nodular, cirrhotic liver with no focal lesions on this
single-phase study.
There is again moderate ascites, with large gastric varices.

3. Normal appearance of intra-abdominal loops of small and large
bowel. No
evidence for colitis or enteritis.

4. Diffuse superficial soft tissue induration, consistent with
cellulitis.
There is no air in the soft tissues to suggest a more aggressive
process such
as necrotizing fasciitis, although this cannot be excluded by
imaging.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2933**] was admitted to the intensive care unit and
underwent vigorous fluid resuscitation and maintained on IV
Flagyl and PO Vancomycin.  He was seen by the infectious disease
service for further input in the treatment of his prolonged C
Diff colitis and they recommended continued treatment with
Flagyl and Vancomycin plus stopping any narcotics as he was at a
high risk of developing toxic megacolon.
His initial blood and urine cultures were negative and stool for
C Diff was positive.
His blood pressure improved with fluids and he did not require
any pressor support.
Vancomycin retention enemas were added for persistent diarrhea
and he underwent serial abdominal CT's to assess any colonic
changes. His abdominal exam over 3-4 days showed mild lower
abdominal tenderness and mild distention therefore continued
conservative non operative treatment with antibiotics was
planned.

Due to his prolonged period of poor nutrition/NPO,
hyperalimentation was started on [**2186-8-10**] and eventually he had a
PICC line placed in the left antecubital on [**2186-8-21**] for TPN and
antibiotics.

Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 2948**] platelet count gradually decreased since
his admission from 130K to a low of 49K. His HIT was negative
and SRA is still pending.  The hematology service was consulted
and felt that it was multifactorial including secondary to
cirrhosis, sepsis and anemia of chronic disease.  Heparin was
not contraindicated and over the course of his hospitalization
his platelet count gradually increased to the 90K range.

Transfer to the [**Known lastname **] floor occured on [**2186-8-12**] and Lasix was
started to try to help with fluid mobilization.  His PE showed
[**4-19**]+ peripheral edema as well as scrotal edema and some ascites.
 He was treated with Lasix on a prn basis and his BUN/Cr
remained stable (22/0.5).

A superficial abdominal cellulitis was noted on [**2186-8-21**] beginning
on both flank areas and extending to the lower abdomen with no
connection to his sacral decubitus. He was started on broad
coverage antibiotics including Vancomycin and Zosyn without
improvement.  He was subsequently changed to Daptomycin,
Ciprofloxicin and Flagyl with some improvement.  Due to the
addition of broad spectrum antibiotics his oral Vancomycin was
increased to QID.  He had no evidence of diarrhea and no change
in his abdominal exam. Recommendations from the infectious
disease service recommends cipro/flagyl/ dapto until [**8-31**] (10
days total).

Pt c diff colitis has responded well to PO vanco. Pt will
continue on 125 [**Hospital1 **] until [**8-31**] when [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] 125 TIDx7d, 125
BIDx7d, 125 qdx7d, 125 qodx7d, 125 q3dx14d.

The Neurology service was consulted during this admission for
evaluation of his bilateral hand tremors which seemed a bit
worse.  Although Parkinson's disease could not be ruled out his
current situation precluded a definite assessment and they
recommended an out patient follow up with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 951**].  His
Depakote continues at his home dose with a level of 53.

A speech and swallow evaluation was also done to assess the
ongoing question od possible aspiration.  His baseline diet was
ground solids however over the last week he was tolerating
nectar thick liquids and pureed with no evidense of aspirating.
He remains on TPN while his diet is being slowly advanced.
Continue on nector thickness liquids and TPN until cleared to
advance, with one to one supervision.

Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 2950**] also impaired skin integrity on his R buttocks first
seen [**2186-8-22**]

[**Month/Day/Year 409**] Assessment by [**Month/Day/Year **] nurse [**2186-8-22**]: Sacral/coccygeal
unstageable pressure ulcer that is a DTI. Ulcer has evidence of
healing with necrotic area measuring 2 cm x 1 cm but affected
area measures 5 x 2 with ulcer on (R) buttock of 1 cm and more
linear ulcers on (L).Drainage is sero sang moderate amount. ALSO
there are superficial erosions on soft tissue of buttocks that
are caused by moisture and fungal rash.The area causes pain. ID
recommended Cipro/flagyl / Dapso treatment and standard [**Month/Day/Year **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old woman
with history of hypertension, who was admitted to an outside
hospital prior to being admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**12-31**].  At the outside hospital the patient
had investigation for two month history of abdominal pain
which showed mainly epigastric.  This work-up included
abdominal CT which showed thickened duodenal valve, 2 cm
adrenal mass, question of colon lesion consistent with
intermittent intestinal obstruction.  Her CEA at the outside
hospital was 41.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**12-31**] with worsening of the abdominal
epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting for two days.  In the
hospital the patient had work-up which included CT angiogram
due to abnormal EKG initially which revealed pulmonary
embolism and patient had been started on Heparin.  Her
initial EKG revealed T wave inversion at V2 and V6 plus ST
depression so she was also admitted for rule out MI.  CT also
revealed dilated common bile duct up to 18 mm.  Her
hematocrit on admission was 29.0 and drifted to 22.5 on
[**1-1**].  She had two episodes of coffee ground emesis on
[**1-1**], became hypotensive and bradycardic and acute EGD was
performed which revealed grade 3 esophagitis in the lower
third, ulcer in the stomach, body and antrum, blood in the
stomach and anterior vault.  There was large oozing clot in
the duodenal bulb.  Hemostasis was achieved with Epinephrine
injection.  Anticoagulation was discontinued and patient was
started on Protonix drip and had been transferred to medical
Intensive Care Unit due to hypotension and active bleeding.
The same day she had IVC filter placed which was done on
[**1-2**].  The patient received two units of FFP followed by 6
units of packed red blood cells.  On [**1-2**] the patient was
transferred back to the medicine floor and on [**1-3**] she had a
second EGD done due to hematocrit of 33.6 which drifted to
32.2.  EGD at that time revealed esophagitis, ulcers in the
antrum which were injected with Epinephrine and also
posterior bulb injection and thermal therapy, a large
inferior posterior duodenal ulcer with oozing refractory to
injection.  For this reason the patient underwent angiography
revealing the source of bleeding and underwent duodenal
gastric artery embolization.  She was then transferred with
additional two units packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit
after transfusion went to 38.5 on [**1-4**].

Other studies during the hospital course included chest x-ray
which revealed widened mediastinum secondary to tortuous and
dilated thoracic aorta and bibasilar atelectasis.  CTA
revealed moderate intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation,
left pulmonary artery embolism and left adrenal mass.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed no DVT, KUB
revealed no obstruction and chest x-ray on [**1-5**] revealed
bilateral small pleural effusion with consolidation of the
lower lobe presenting either atelectasis or infection.  She
was transferred to general medicine floor on [**1-5**].

decreased urine output the prior two days, no chest pain
although she does have some shortness of breath and abdominal
pain over the past few days.  She feels weak and has diffuse
aches and pains.  She has a history of GI bleed in the
setting of anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism.  In
[**2174-2-18**] she underwent embolization of a duodenal artery
by interventional radiology at that time.  She has a large
pancreatic mass requiring gastrojejunostomy done by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] because of stricture/obstruction.  She has not
noticed any melena or bright red blood per rectum.  In the
Emergency Room she was with blood pressure 80/60, hematocrit
12.5, received one liter of normal saline, one unit of packed
red blood cells.  EGD showed bleeding of a pancreatic mass in
the stomach.  Patient and family wanted to proceed with IR
intervention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic pancreatic cancer, biliary
cancer with mets to the liver diagnosed in [**2-19**] during GJ
tube placement with liver biopsy.  Pulmonary embolism status

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol use, she immigrated 9
years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had esophageal cancer, mother had a
stroke, brother has lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission is notable for
temperature 97.7, pulse 79, blood pressure 94/63,
respirations 15.  100% sat on room air.  In general, alert
and oriented times three, no acute distress, Russian
speaking.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, right
IJ line in place, no lymphadenopathy.  Heart tachycardic, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Chest is clear to auscultation
bilaterally, no wheezes or rales.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
active bowel sounds, positive ascites.  Extremities, no
edema, dorsalis pedis pulses +2 bilaterally.  Neuro, cranial
nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 13.2, hematocrit 12.5,
platelet count 219,000, INR 1.3, BUN 56, creatinine 1.0.
LFTs within normal limits.  CK and troponin within normal
limits.  Albumin 2.9.  EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 86 with
normal axis, normal intervals, a Q in lead 3 which is old
with flipped T in 1 and 2 and 3 which is new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and taken to the
Intensive Care Unit.  For left GI bleed she received multiple
units of packed red blood cells and then a stable hematocrit
after transfusions in the mid 30's.  EGD was done which
showed a bleeding pancreatic mass and therefore patient went
to angiography, had embolization of her gastroduodenal branch
with good results.  She has been hemodynamically stable since
the procedure and was called out of the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2174-6-9**].  The procedure was complicated with right groin
hematoma which has since improved.  A radiation oncology
consult was obtained to evaluate for palliative radiation to
the site of her mass.  They felt it would not be of benefit.
After discussion with the family and with the patient, we
decided on no further treatment at this time for the
malignancy but to try to optimize her status by transferring
her to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehab.  Her PO intake has been
gradually increased with the normal 50 cc IV fluids.  Also of
note, her CKs were normal and her blood pressure was
initially low and then as it increased the Metoprolol and
then the Captopril were able to be added back on.  She had
occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia which all
stopped spontaneously.  Her hematocrit after 6 units of
packed red blood cells is in the mid 30's.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On admission he denied fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or cough.  He denied bright red
blood per rectum.  He denied melena.  He denied urinary
symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
temperature of 98, blood pressure of 140/84, pulse of 54,
respiratory rate of 18, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
In general, a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed anicteric.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  First heart sound and second heart sound.  A [**1-24**]
murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation.  Pulmonary
revealed clear breath sounds anteriorly and laterally.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed right groin site was clean,
dry, and intact; no bruits.  Pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologically alert and oriented times three, mentating
well.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a white blood cell count of 8.2,
hematocrit of 38.7, platelets of 285.  INR of 1.1, PTT of 29,
PT of 12.4.  Sodium of 137, potassium of 4.5, chloride
of 100, bicarbonate of 27, blood urea nitrogen of 20,
creatinine of 1.1, blood sugar on admission was 333.
Creatine kinase was 71.  Troponin I was less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization; please see full report for complete results.
Briefly, the patient had 50% in-stent restenosis of the left
anterior descending artery, 90% ostial stenosis of the
circumflex.  Right coronary artery with no significant
obstructive disease.

He also underwent an echocardiogram; please see full report
for complete details.  Briefly, the patient had no wall
motion abnormalities noted.  He had mild aortic stenosis
seen.  Atrial septal defect secondary to evidence of
right-to-left flow.  The atrial septal defect was small.  His
ejection fraction was 55%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**4-5**], the patient was taken to the
operating room and he underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times three; left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal, left radial to ramus intermedius.  Please see the
Operative Note for full details.  The patient was told the
operation went well and was transferred from the operating
room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer the patient was in normal sinus
rhythm.  He had an arterial line, a central venous pressure
right atrial catheter, two ventricular pacing wires, two
atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal chest tubes, and one
pleural chest tube.

Intravenous drips included ""cariporide"" (study drug),
nitroglycerin, and propofol.  Shortly after being in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, the patient was started
on Nipride for increased blood pressure and an insulin drip
for a blood sugar of greater than 194.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He was weaned off his sedation, and he was weaned from the
ventilatory and extubated successfully.   On postoperative
day one, the patient was weaned off Nipride drip.  He
continued on the insulin drip, and he was restarted on half
of his dose of Lantus insulin.  He continued to do well.

On postoperative day two, the patient became confused.  He
was given Haldol, and after approximately 24 hours his
confusion resolved.  He was restarted on his Nipride for
hypertension.

On postoperative day three, the patient went into a rapid
atrial fibrillation which converted to normal sinus rhythm as
the amiodarone bolus and drip was started.  His temperature
spike on that day was 101.8, and he was found to have a
urinary tract infection; for which he was started on a 5-day
course of Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.

On postoperative day four, the patient again went into atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 100 to 130.  He received an
additional amiodarone bolus and was started on p.o.
amiodarone.  He then converted to normal sinus rhythm.  A
heparin drip was started on that day.

On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six.  By this time, the insulin drip, Nipride drip, and
amiodarone drip had been weaned off.  He was on p.o.
amiodarone, and he had been started on Imdur on [**4-7**] for
his arterial graft site.  Once transferred to the floor, the
patient's Lopressor dose and Imdur dose had been increased
due to hypertension and also frequent episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  He continued on his p.o. dose of amiodarone as
well.

On postoperative day six, the patient was noted to have
increased blood sugars and was also noted to have right arm
thrombophlebitis in the antecubital area.  The patient was
started on Ancef 1 g intravenously q.8h., and the patient's
blood sugars were being covered by a sliding-scale insulin.
Also the patient was being followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.  On
a daily basis the patient had  been seen by Physical Therapy.
His activity level had increased with the assistance of
Physical Therapy and the nursing staff.

The patient was due to be discharged from the hospital on
postoperative day seven after 24 hours of antibiotics for his
thrombophlebitis and reassessment of the patient's blood
sugars.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs revealed
temperature of 98.1, heart rate of 98 (atrial fibrillation),
respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure of 151/67.  Blood
sugar at this time was 300.  Skin revealed right antecubital
thrombophlebitis, erythematous.  Chest incision was intact
with slight redness in the lower pole of the incision.  Left
radial artery incision was intact with slight redness with
clear drainage in the distal end.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed irregularly irregular with a blowing murmur heard
best at the apex.  Chest was clear to auscultation.  Abdomen
was soft, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed
palpable pulses in the bilateral arms and feet.  Bilateral
fingers were cool.  Feet were warm.  Neurologically, alert

Pertinent Results:
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2117-2-10**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Angina
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Multi-vessel native coronary disease.
2. Atretic LIMA-LAD
3. Patent SVG-OM and Radial graft to RI
4. Successful stenting of native OM with 2.0 x 18mm Pixel stent.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed multi-vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was without
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a mild, 30% ISRS
but was
otherwise without flow-limiting disease. A D1 branch had a mild
40%
lesion. The LCX had a tight, 99% origin lesion, but the distal
and AV
groove vessel filled well. The RCA had a 50% ostial lesion but
was
otherwise without flow limiting disease.
2. Graft angiography revealed an atretic LIMA-LAD. The SVG-OM
had
patent stents but a 90% lesion just beyond the most distal stent
in a
small native OM vessel. The Radial graft was without flow
limiting
disease.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated
central
aortic pressure 148/71.
4. Successful placement of 2.0 x 18 mm Pixel stent in the native
OM
distal to the SVG-OM bypass graft with significant effort. Final
angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection, and normal flow

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2117-2-15**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Known CAD, prior CABG, recent PCI, rest pain with concern for
stent
thrombosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely diseased SVG-OM bypass graft.
3. Central hypertension.
4. Unsuccessful treatment of SVG-OM bypass graft disease.
5. Unsuccessful treatment of chronically, totally occluded OM.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated
native three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
flow-limiting coronary disease. The LAD had a 40% in-stent
restenosis
(ISR) of a previously placed midvessel stent without other
significant
flow-limiting disease. The LCx was subtotally occluded
proimximally with
a totally occluded OM1. The ramus intermedius was totally
occluded
ostially.
2. Graft angigoraphy demonstrated a SVG-OM with thrombotic
occlusion
as well as TIMI 1 flow. The previously stented distal native
vessel
after the touchdown of this graft did not fill. The SVG-RI was
without
flow-limiting disease. The LIMA was not selectively engaged as
shown to
be atretic at the last catheterization.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension
with
blood pressure 177/83 mmHg.
4. Unsuccessful treatment of thrombotic SVG-OM with TIMI 1 flow
despite attempts to remove the thrombus burden mechanically,
administration of intra-coronary medications, and balloon
angioplasty of
the previously placed distal stents. Final angiography
demonstrated
continued thrombus burden, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and
slow flow (See PTCA Comments).
5. Unsuccessful treatment of native chronically, totally
occluded OM
due to inability to cross despite aggressive guide position and
aggressive wire choices.

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  30% to 40%  >= 55%
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Moderate global LV hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis initially with bradycardia (LVEF =
30%) that improves with pacing to 80/min (LVEF 40%).. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is seen with good leaflet motion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen (focused color Doppler). The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No definite mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] was admitted one day prior to his surgery to be
started on Heparin (he d/c'd Coumadin 4 days prior to admission)
and undergo complete pre-operative work-up. On [**10-8**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a
redo-sternotomy, coronary artery bypass graft x 1, and aortic
valve replacement. Please see operative report for surgical
details. In summary he had a redo sternotomy with AVR(#21
[**Company 1543**] Mosaic porcine) and CABGx1(SVG-Pda). His bypass time
was 94 minutes with a crossclamp of 65 minutes. he tolerated the
operation well and following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. In the
immediate post-op period he remained hemodynamically stable, his
anesthesia was reversed he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Endocrine/[**Last Name (un) **] were
consulted post-op to assist with patients poor diabetes control
(recent A1C 8%). On post-op day one he was started on beta
blockers and diuretics. On POD2 he was transferred from the ICU
to the stepdown floor for continued care. Once on the floor he
had several episodes of atrial fibrillation which were treated
with Beta blockers. Following beta blockade Mr [**Known lastname 23**] had
symptomatic bradycardia and was transferred back to the ICU for
closer monitoring, EP service was consulted and a permenant
pacemaker was placed on [**10-14**].
On POD7/1 he was again transferred to the stepdown floor. Over
the next several days the patients activity level was advanced
and he was anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation. On POD
[**10-23**] he was discharged home with visiting nurses. His INR is to
be drawn by the VNA on [**10-21**] and coumadin dosing is to be
followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2204**].

Imaging:
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2123-11-12**] Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and complex atheroma n the descending thoracic
aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or
abscess seen. Normal functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis.
Mildly depressed left ventricular function. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast in the left atrium without evidence of thrombus in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2123-11-15**] CONCLUSION:
1. No finding to suggest acute vascular territorial infarct; in
this setting, MRI with DWI (if feasible) would be more
sensitive.
2. Evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Chronic inflammatory disease involving the bilateral sphenoid
air cells
with superimposed acute inflammation involving the left sphenoid
air cell;
correlate clinically.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2123-11-17**]  IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the right
clinical
setting, less likely atelectasis.
2. No pulmonary vascular congestion.

RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2123-11-23**]  IMPRESSION: Normal renal
ultrasound. 2.4 cm exophytic left lower pole renal cyst.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2123-11-24**] IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema and
enlargement of still small layering bilateral pleural effusions.

2. Persistent retrocardiac opacification that could either
represent
atelectasis though pneumonia is also a possibility in the
correct clinical
setting.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) Study Date of [**2123-11-24**]  IMPRESSION: No
ileus or obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o M with a history of CHF, afib, DM2, CAD with a history of
CABG s/p recent PCI in early [**2123-10-19**] with DES to LAD and
distal PDA presented to [**Hospital1 **] with fever, malaise, R arm
weakness and was found to have transaminitis, bandemia, and ARF.
The patient was put on nafcillin for MSSA but developed anuria
and increase in creatinine. The patient was stabilized and
started on steroids, at which point the patient was presented to
our service.

##MSSA Bacteremia presenting as sepsis.  Likely source thought
to be due to introduction of skin bacteria during recent
coronary angiogram/PCI.  TEE on [**11-12**] did not show vegetation.
Pt was followed by ID with plan to treat with 4 week course of
naficillin until [**12-8**].The patient became anuric and his
creatinine bumped on nafcillin, so he was switched to cefazolin,
on which he developed a rash. It is unclear if the rash was from
the nafcillin or the cefazolin. In any case, we switched him to
vancomycin to be safe. He is to complete his course on [**12-8**].
Goal trough is 15-20. Given his poor kidney function, he will
require daily trough with dosing daily to maintain that trough.
The course will complete on [**12-8**].
.
#Acute renal failure d/t AIN
Pt developed progressive renal failure, which was concerning for
probable AIN due to nafcillin.  Nafcillin was discontinued, and
Nephrology was consulted.  Due to worsening renal function, pt
became progressively fluid overloaded.  Diuresis was attepted
with aggressive diuretics (Metolazone 5 mg followed by Lasix 120
mg IV, BID), with minimal response. Pt became nearly anuric, and
pt subsequently developed uremia with asterixis. Pt was also
symptomatic from volume overload, with mild dyspnea at rest,
cough, nausea, early satiety, and poor appetite (likely d/t
bowel edema).  Pt was started on empiric steroids on [**2123-11-25**] for
presumed AIN after discussion with both Nephrology and ID.  He
will continue on Prednisone, and will taper over the next 30
days. His discharge dose is 50mg /day and it will be tapered by
5mg every 3 days until the course is completed. Urgent HD access
was obtained by Interventional Radiology, as pt is
anticoagulated on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation, as well as
aspirin and plavix.  Pt underwent his first round of HD on
[**2123-11-26**]. The patient required dialysis until [**2123-11-29**] at which
point his urine output increase significantly and we would
evaluate him daily, both in terms of his I/Os, and in terms of
his electrolytes and kidney function labs.  The patient did not
require any further HD, and his catheter was pulled and the
patient was discharged. The patient is to have CBC and Chem7
drawn and faxed to the nephrologists on Monday [**12-6**] for follow
up.

#NSTEMI: type 2 MI due to demand in setting of sepsis presenting
with arm discomfort.  Troponin peak to 0.46 on [**11-13**].
Cardiology recommended continued medical management of known CAD
with ASA/plavix (recent PCI in early [**Month (only) **]).  His dose of
statin reduced in context of use of amiodarone.  On discharge,
we decided to increase his statin dose to 80mg (home dose),
given his history of recent MI in [**Month (only) **].

#Diabetes Type 2: uncontrolled with complications (MI): he is on
aggressive insulin regmin including parandial humalog and basal
lantus at home.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and helped up titrate his
SS and basal insulin for better glucose control.  [**Last Name (un) **]
continued to follow and make recommendations. On 2 occasions,
the patient was found to have a glucose aroudn 50-60. On one
occasion, the patient was difficult to arouse, but was easily
reversed with dextrose. On the second occasion, he was
completely asymptomatic, though dextrose was given anyways. The
patient's sliding scale and daily NPH dose has been adjusted
based on [**Hospital1 4087**] recs. The patient should have his glucose
monitored and his insulin should be adjusted according to his
glucose trends. It is likely that his insulin requirements will
change as his prednisone is tapered.

#Afib: paroxysmal afib known on history with afib and RVR during
ICU stay requiring a combination of betablockers and CCB as well
as initiation of amiodarone.  He underwent DCCV on [**11-16**] with
return of NSR.  Since then he has been on toprol XL and
amiodarone 400mg TID.  As of [**11-21**] he received 9300mg loading
dose of amiodarone and was transitioned to 200mg amiodarone
daily with f/u with cardiology to decide on any further need of
admiodarone.  He was anticoagulated with coumadin.  His INR
should be trended daily and his coumadin dose should be adjusted
accordingly, as his coumadin requirements may be different now
with his diminished kidney function.  He was discharged at a
dose of 3mg per day and INR 1.8.

#Question of stroke: presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at [**Hospital1 18**] with aphasia and
R upper extremity weakness with old strokes on non-contrast head
CT done at OSH.  Seen by neurology in ICU who felt that symptoms
could be due to recrudescence of previous stroke or possibly a
small new stroke in setting of sepsis.  An MRI was not possible
because he has a pacemaker.  A repeat CT performed 72 h after CT
done at [**Location (un) 620**] did not show evidence of stroke.  He reamined on
anticoagulation given afib and high risk of stroke given
CHADS2>=4.  His speech returned to baseline and he did not have
further extremity weakness other than L shoulder due to
suspected rotator cuff tear.

#Rotator cuff tear: inability to comfortable move L shoulder
with discomfort in upper arm.  Xray showed degenerative joint
disease.  Ortho consult suspected partial rotator cuff tear on
physical exam and recommended ROM as tolerated with outpatient
f/u in the sports medicine clinic.  His shoulder improved during
the course of the hospitalization.

#Thyroid function abnormalities: PMH documents history of
hypothyroidism and home med included levothyroxine, but dose of
20mcg is very low for someone his size.  TSH low at 0.042, free
T4 slightly high at 4.5.  Rather than repeat TFTs in acute
setting which could be abnormal for sick euthyroid, his dose of
levothyroxine was discontinued and recommend close outpatient
monitoring of TSH, free T4 as he is now on amiodarone.

#R cephalic vein clot noted on U/S of R upper arm, not a DVT

#Transitional Issues:
Please follow daily INR and vancomycin trough. His vancomycin
and coumadin doses need to be adjusted accordingly. His goal INR
is [**1-21**]. His goal trough is 15-20 until [**12-8**]. If the patient's
trough is less than 16, he is to get a dose of 500mg of
vancomycin. If the trough is greater than 16, the dose is to be
held for that day. He should also have a full CBC/Chem7 done on
Monday [**12-6**] and the results should be faxed to [**Numeric Identifier 4088**].

History of Present Illness:
76M complicated past medical history including CAD status post
CABG, s/p stents [**Month (only) **]/[**2122**] (on aspirin and plavix), status post
biologic AVR, CHF with EF 35-40 %, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on coumadin (now off secondary to recent epistaxis
requiring blood transfusion), history of strokes, CKD (baseline
Cr 2.5) with recent kidney injury thought to be secondary to AIN
from naficllin requiring hemodialysis, now off. He presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with lethargy. Patient states that he awoke this
morning feeling unwell. He had no specific or localizing signs.

He was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 4103**] on the [**Hospital **] Rehab
Facility 3 days prior to presentation. He had been there since
an admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for MSSA bacteremia complicated by what
appears to be acute kidney injury from acute interstitial
nephritis thought to be secondary to nafcillin. He also
developed diffuse skin vasculitis at that time.  He had been on
steroids which had been tapered to off about 2 weeks ago.  He
has also had intermittent delirium and volume overload.  It
appears an NSTEMI also complicated his course.

He had an episode of epistaxis for which he was admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] from [**1-1**] to [**1-3**] with an INR greater than 10 at the
time.  He is no longer on Coumadin but he is on aspirin and
Plavix.  He has had no further bleeding.  He has also had recent
transaminitis thought to be secondary to amiodarone and statin.
He had had a right upper quadrant ultrasounds which did not
reveal acute cholecystitis but did show gallstones in the
gallbladder.  His amiodarone has been discontinued but it
appears he is back on his simvastatin.

At [**Hospital1 **], the patient complained of pain in his penis from
Foley catheter insertion in the emergency department.

He denies shortness of breath, fever, chills, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain.  He notes a mild
nonproductive cough over the last few days.  He reports his
white blood cell count has been elevated intermittently in the
past.  It was elevated at NewBridge; however, repeat was normal
and he was sent home.

Per his wife he had an episode of confusion in the morning with
some
urinary incontinence.  He is now back at his baseline.  He is
AAOx3.

It was also noted that he has had recent increase in lower
extremity edema which was thought to be secondary to his
prednisone. His lasix was increased to 80 mg PO BID from 40 mg
PO BID about a week and a half ago. His lower extremities have
improved in terms of swelling. He also reports improvement of
the vasculitic rash now scabbing.

For his diabetes, his lantus was recently increased from 22
units to 26 units as he has been having elevated blood glucose
which began at NewBridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **].

In the ER at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have acute renal
injury with Cr of 3.1 (baseline ~ 2.5) as well as hyperkalemia
(K 6.1). He was treated with 8 units of IV insulin, Kayexalate,
and calcium gluconate. He was also given 2.5 L of IVF per
records.

CXR was felt to show possible left lower infiltrate. He was
given levofloxacin and vancomycin.

Studies were significant for:

Na 132 K 6.1, Cl 99, HCO3 26, BUN 71, Cr 3.1, Glc 355
WBC 16.6(H), Hct 30.6, Plt 376 MCV 81 with Diff N 77, M 13

Lactate 2.7
UA: Blood moderate, nitrate, LE negative, RBC [**4-27**], WBC 0-2, Occ
epi
EKG: NSR at 77 bpm, PR prolongation, RBBB. No acute ST-T changes

CXR: Poor quality. Increased density in inferior portion of
chest on lateral view likely represents pleural fluid, probably
on the right, prominent cardiac silhouette
Head CT (prelim): Left maxillary sinus disease. No acute
intracranial pathology.
RUQ US (prelim): No [**Doctor Last Name **] sign. No pericholecystic fluid.
STones in neck of gallbladder. Gallbladder wall distended at 5
mm and had been 3 mm. No dilated ducts.

There was concern given leukocytosis and CXR showing ? pneumonia
and his new onset renal failure.

Given elevated LFTS, a RUQ US was performed that showed 5 mm
gallbladder wall (up from 3 mm two weeks ago) with stones in the
neck of the gallbladder. There was no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Flagyl was subsequently added for broader coverage. A surgery
consult was called in the ER for aforementioned findings. The
impression was that although the patient has no abdominal
tenderness that given his diabetes his clinical exam may be
altered. His leukocytosis may be secondary to ? developing
pneumonia; however, his gallbladder wall is thickened and the
patient will likely require percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
His LFTs are difficult to interpret in context of acute illness,
and his CBD is not dilated.

He was transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for ? cholecystitis for
potential surgical procedure.

VS on transfer were T 98.2, BP 126/68, HR 74, RR 17, pOx 98 % RA
Urine output 475 mL
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED inital vitals were, 17:57 97.0 74 113/60 20 100%

Labs in [**Hospital1 18**] ER showed Na 137, K 5.4, Cl 104, HCO3 20, Lactate
2.6, Glc 271. Hgb was 10.

A general surgery consult was called in the ER. Impression was
admission to medicine with monitoring of LFTs and serial
abdominal exams. A percutaneous chole tube was not advised at
this time.

VS on transfer: AF, HR 74, BP 139/67, RR 22, pOx 100 % 3L

On arrival to the ICU, patient was initially sleepy, but then
awoke and wanted a piece of toast - which was given after
explaining that it would be optimal if he remained NPO given
concern for gallbladder process.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2124-1-25**]**

   CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2124-1-25**]):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      212 AU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 AU/ml, Positive >= 6 AU/ml.


   CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2124-1-25**]):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      BORDERLINE POSITIVE.
      INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
      A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
      Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may
reactivate
      when immunity is compromised.
      Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2111**] mg/dl
may cause
      interference with CMV IgM results.
      Interpret IgM result with caution; liver disease,
autoimmune and
      lymphoproliferative diseases may cause false positive
results.

.
[**1-20**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior
fascicular block. Possible inferior myocardial infarction, age
inderminate. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Diffuse low QRS
voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2123-12-17**] the QRS
voltage has decreased.
.
HIDA [**1-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal visualization of gallbladder.
2. Small bowel activity not visualized. Patient refused further
imaging.
.
[**1-21**] CXR:
Previous mild pulmonary edema has almost cleared. Substantial
consolidation persists at both lung bases, consistent with
pneumonia, particularly on the left. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are presumed. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic, but
improved since [**1-20**]. No pneumothorax. Constellation of
external wires makes it impossible to determine if there is a
right PIC line in place. No pneumothorax.
.
[**1-22**] CXR-unchanged

[**1-24**] RUQ u/s:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without specific signs of cholecystitis.
2. Normal flow and spectral analysis in the liver vasculature.
.
[**1-24**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of right-sided PICC. Increase
in
cardiomediastinal widening and cardiomegaly probably a function
of cardiac
insufficiency.



[**2124-1-25**] 04:16PM BLOOD PT-17.3* PTT-33.8 INR(PT)-1.6*

Brief Hospital Course:
76M CAD s/p CABG and PCI with stents placed a few months ago,
systolic CHF, pAF, CKD III, and DM2, presenting with lethargy,
acute renal failure, pneumonia and possible  cholecystitis.
.
# Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
Patient had episode of brief confusion this AM. Per prior
medical records, patient can sometimes be confused. DDx includes
toxic-metabolic process in setting of renal dysfunction,
infectious process, or primary neurogenic process among others.
Latter unlikely given negative head CT and non-focal neuro exam.
Favor metabolic encephalopathy. On admission, patient AAOx3. His
mental status remained intact for the remainder of the
hospitalization.
.
# Leukocytosis/HCAP-
Patient presented with leukocytosis to 16.6 with neutrophilia on
differential. He was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and
appeared to be perfusing well in the ICU. No adrenergic state or
recent steroids to explain elevated white count. There was
concern for infectious etiology given cough and evidence of PNA
with HCAP risk and initially ? cholecystitis in setting of
cholestatic LFTs (However, HIDA-limited study returned negative
and abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis not
cholecystitis. Lactate was initially elevated at 2.7 initially
at BIDN s/p IVF with admission lactate 1.3. Initially, he was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including aztreonam,
flagyl, and vancomycin for both pulmonary and GI process.
Aztreonam was later switched to ciprofloxacin. The clinical
picture overall was consistent with HCAP but not acute
cholecystitis as pt did not have any abdominal pain. He
clinically improved and was transferred to the floor on [**1-21**]. He
spiked a temperature to 100.9 with leukocytosis to 20K.
Ciprofloxacin was switched to cefepime to optimize gram negative
coverage. He defervesced, leukocytosis improved, and oxygen was
weaned to room air for which he remained. Final antibiotic
regimen is IV vanco/cefepime/flagyl x8 total days. Vanco and
flagyl to end on [**1-28**] and cefepime to end on [**1-29**]. PICC line was
placed and can be removed after antibiotic course is complete.
.
# Transaminitis
He has had elevated LFTs in past thought to be drug-induced from
amiodarone and atorvastatin (which were held) in outpatient
setting. Pattern appeared to be both hepatocellular and
cholestatic concerning for aforementioned gallbladder process
with uncharacterized liver disease. Hepatitis viral serologies
were sent and were negative. HIDA scan was limited but,
unremarkable. RUQ US with doppler was negative. Off the statin,
the transaminases improved, and this was thought to be the most
likely etiology. Statin was not resumed during admission, but
this can be considered after further outpatient monitoring
especially given recent stent placement. Pt did not have any
abdominal pain while on the medical floor.
.
# Acute renal failure on CKD. New baseline appears to be ~2.3.
Range was 2.3-2.7 during admission.Attributed to increased lasix
dosage (80mg [**Hospital1 **] from 40mg [**Hospital1 **]) over past few weeks as well as
poor PO intake. FeUREA on admission 34%, also consistent with
pre-renal process. Recently, pt had AIN from nafcillin and had
to be temporarily dialyzed. He also received and completed a
course of prednisone therapy prior to admission. Cr ranged from
2.3-2.7 during admission and was 2.3 on day of discharge. Pt
should have his creatinine monitored daily while on antibiotic
therapy including vanco and cefepime. Of note, the renal team
monitored the patient closely during admission. His lasix was
restarted at 20mg daily on [**1-25**] given evidence of CHF seen on CXR
as well as slightly increased peripheral edema. Pt was not
hypoxic. Renal follow up arranged for 2 weeks after discharge.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Compensated during admission.
BB dose was decreased to 50mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]. Lasix was
restarted on [**1-25**] at 20mg daily. Had been held recently due to
ARF. Pt is not on an ACEI presumable due to recent ARF/AIN. [**Month (only) 116**]
consider in the future should Cr stabilize. Would follow I/o's
and daily weights closely and uptitrate lasix prn pending
creatinine values.
.
# atrial fibrillation: Pt with pacemaker. Pt was placed on 50mg
[**Hospital1 **] metoprolol during admission with well controlled HR
(initially held given concern for sepsis). Pt with recent
history of significant epistaxis vs. hemoptysis [**12/2123**] per OSH
reports. Warfarin was restarted on 2.4 as his risk of CVA
currently outweighs risk of bleeding. Pt was given 2.5mg daily.
INR's remained subtherapeutic. INR 1.6 on day of discharge.
Warfarin can be continually uptitrated prn after discharge. He
was not given bridging therapy given the recent history of
bleeding.
.
# CAD, s/p prior CABG and DES x2 in [**Month (only) **]: stable. BB was
restarted with discharge dose of 50mg [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol. Pt was
continued on asa and plavix. Statin was held given
transaminitis. This may be able to be restarted in outpatient
setting after close monitoring of LFTs. An appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4104**] of cardiology in [**Location (un) 620**] was made prior to discharge.
.
#HTN-continued BB.
.
# DM II uncontrolled with complications: Glucose was monitored
closely, and once he was taking good po on the medical floor, he
sometimes refused insulin and became markedly hyperglycemic.
Lantus insulin dose was increased to 30U, and he was maintained
on a Humalog sliding scale. See attached.
.
# Anemia: chronic disease, stable Hct. Pt can continue PO iron
[**Hospital1 **] as per outpatient regimen. HCT on discharge 29.3. Baseline
appears to be between 27-30. Further outpatient work up, such as
colonscopy, can be considered prn.
.
# BPH: stable on outpatient medications

# Hypothyroidism: continued synthyroid.

# ??History of strokes: resumed warfarin as noted above

# Skin impairment: Patient has notable skin impairment on
bilateral feet, also ? stage II decubitus ulcer. Wound care team
was consulted and made helpful recommendations.

# CODE STATUS: Was DNR/DNI on admission, but while in the [**Name (NI) 153**],
pt changed code status to Full Code. This can be continually
addressed upon discharge. Pt expressed frustration with frequent
admissions and rehab stays.
.

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male with sCHF (EF 35-40%), AS s/p biologic AVR, CAD,
pAF, DMII c/b neuropathy, hypothyroidism and stage III/IV CKD,
with a recent admission for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia, who presented from
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with SOB and altered mental status. He was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 4108**] with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia
(no evidence of endophthalmitis and TEE without evidence of
Endocarditis) with a hospital course complicated by a left IJ
DVT (for which he was bridged to Coumadin with Heparin), acute
on CKD (CKD [**1-20**] AIN, most likely [**1-20**] Nafcillin, with baseline
creatinine of ~ 2.3, 2.9 at discharge on [**2124-2-3**]), and a
systolic CHF exacerbation.
.
He was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2124-2-3**]. He states that
since his discharge he has been profoundly short of breath with
minimal exertion, especially over the last few days. He states
that initially he was making good urine to his Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
but that one to two days ago he stopped making urine. He was
also noted to be increasingly confused at [**Hospital1 **].
.
On [**2124-2-11**], he was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] Emergency Department for
severe SOB and altered mental status. On arrival to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
he was noted to be hypotensive. A right IJ central line was
placed and he was given Zosyn and started on Levophed prior to
transfer. A BNP was reportedly 34,000. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for concern for hypotension from CHF vs. sepsis.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial vitals were 97.5, 60, 96/54,
25, 91%on RA. The Levophed was discontinued but his blood
pressure subsequently dropped to 56/46 and the Levophed was
restarted. His CBC was notable for a WBC of 17.9 with 82.1% PMNs
but no bands. His extended chemistry was notable for a potassium
of 5.6, HCO3 of 20, a BUN of 85, a Cr of 4.7, a calcium of 7.6,
and a phosphorus of 9.5. His lactate was 5.2 and his INR was
4.1. A CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema. He received
Vancomycin, zosyn and 100 cc of NS. His vital signs at transfer
were 99/50, 62, 17, 94 on 4L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his vitals were 96, 64, 113/56 (on 0.12
mcg/kg/min), 24, 97% on 4L. He looked uncomfortable but was in
no apparent distress. He reported the history as detailed above.
He additionally reported a nagging non-productive cough in
addition to his worsening DOE. He denied any recent fevers,
chills, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Urine cx [**2-12**]: negative
Blood cultures 2/25: pending, negative to date

[**2124-2-12**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis and inferior
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2124-2-12**]:
1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in
the right atrium. Consider retraction by approximately 2-3 cm.
2. Mild interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
3. Bilateral collapse/cponsolidation and possible small
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
76M with sCHF (EF 35-40%), AS s/p biologic AVR, CAD, pAF, DMII
c/b neuropathy, hypothyroidism and stage III/IV CKD, with a
recent admission for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] fungemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension and initial concern for sepsis vs. CHF.
 Given concern for possible sepsis, he was continued on
fluconazole, and also started on broad spectrum antibiotics
(vanco/meropenem).  However, further work-up revealed his
clinical picture was more suggestive of cardiogenic shock in the
setting of decompensated sCHF.  The patient's physical exam and
CXR were consistent with left and right heart failure.  A repeat
TTE showed worsened right heart failure.  His central venous O2
was 36 and his CVP 23.  As he was hypotensive with evidence of
significant end-organ damage, diuresis was not an option.  The
patient was continued on norepinephrine for blood pressure
support.  Renal was consulted, and the patient was initiated on
CVVH.  With CVVH, approximately 6.5L of fluid were removed, with
improvement in patient's respiratory status.   He was weaned off
pressors.  However, the patient continued to have profoundly
altered mental status and tenuous respiratory status.  After
further discussion between the MICU team and the patient's
family, a decision was made to transition to comfort focused
care.  Dialysis was stopped, and his HD line was removed.
A-line removed.  Antibiotics were stopped, and all other
medications were discontinued.  The patient was called out to
floor.  Palliative care and social work were consulted.  The
patient was started on morphine as needed for dyspnea, lorazepam
as needed for anxiety, and a scopolamine patch to help with
secretions.  The patient expired on [**2124-2-16**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right middle lobe bronchus
stent removal with hemoptysis/airway secretion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 53-year-old female with
past medical history significant for Stage III-B nonsmall
cell lung cancer diagnosed in fall of [**2142**] with recurrent C,
Factor VIII deficiency, and epilepsy, who presents with
hemoptysis, and excessive secretions status post right main
bronchus stent removal.  Originally patient was diagnosed
with nonsmall cell lung cancer in fall of [**2142**], and was
treated with XRT and chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol.
Her disease reoccurred in [**2143-5-5**], and she was again
treated with XRT with minimal response.  The lung cancer had
then progressed.

On [**2145-5-3**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy (via cytology
revealed nonsmall cell lung cancer) with stent placement in
the bronchus intermedius.  Poststent CT demonstrated adequate
placement.  However, the patient was unable to tolerate the
stent with persistent cough and increased secretions.  She
presents today for elective stent removal.  The procedure was
complicated by 150 cc of hemoptysis poststent removal which
was controlled with suctioning and airway protection.

On arrival, the patient complains of shortness of breath with
increased nonbloody secretions which is improved with
nebulized lidocaine.  She also complains of mild anterior
right chest discomfort which is chronic and pleuritic.  She
denies any nausea, vomiting, headache, chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Stage III-B (T4 M0 N0) nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed
in fall of [**2142**] treated with carboplatin/Taxol induction with
low dose XRT.  She also had a second XRT treatment in [**2143-5-5**] and had suffered some radiation pneumonitis.
2. Catanenial epilepsy treated in [**2134**].
3. Factor VIII deficiency.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Klonopin 0.25 mg po q4h, 0.5 mg po q hs.
2. Estrogen 0.3 mg po q day.
3. Progesterone 200 mg po q day.
4. Albuterol prn.

ALLERGIES:  Chemical sensitivity to quinolones, macrolides,
aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and penicillin.
She develops hives with levofloxacin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married with two children.  She has a
30 pack year smoking history, who quit in [**2142-9-4**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with lung cancer and hemophilia,
maternal grandmother with breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  144/81, 100% on
face mask, respiratory rate 34, pulse of 133, temperature
96.5.  Generally, this is a white female in mild distress,
appearing anxious.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae with clear dry
oropharynx.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck
is supple without lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary:  Decreased
breath sounds in the right base [**4-6**] of the way up with some
bronchial breath sounds, egophony, and decreased tactile
fremitus.  The left lung is clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, normal S1, S2.  No murmurs or
thrills noted.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema noted.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented
times three and moving all four extremities.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count is 7.1, hematocrit
31.7, platelets 584.  Sodium 136, potassium 4, chloride 98,
bicarb 21, BUN 10, creatinine 0.4, glucose 144, calcium 9.1,
magnesium 1.5, phosphate is 3.9.  Bronchial brushing showed a
positive sample of nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.  Pleural
fluid on [**5-3**] show reactive mesothelial cells and no
malignant cells.  On [**2145-4-5**] chest CT scan status post stent
showed stent in the right upper lobe bronchus marked with
narrowing of origin in the right middle bronchus, moderate
pericardial effusion, small partial loculated right pleural
effusion, right middle lobe opacity, and diffuse emphysema.

A [**2145-5-21**] chest x-ray showed moderate large right pleural
effusion, new consistent with compared with chest x-ray on
[**2145-5-7**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary - Hemoptysis:  Patient was initially admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit to keep her saturation above 92%.
Her secretions and cough were managed with Fentanyl and
saline nebulizer treatments.  She did not have any episode of
hemoptysis while in the Intensive Care Unit, and actually
came down from her oxygen requirement from 100% nonrebreather
to sating 90% 4-5 liters. Her hematocrit remained stable.
She was called out to the floor where she was quite stable
until the second day on the medical floor, where she then
experienced three tablespoons of hemoptysis.  She was then
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
observation.  Her hematocrit remained stable and her
hemoptysis decreased in frequency from seven episodes a day
to just five episodes a day with sputum production consistent
with a rust colored phlegm.  She had no frank hemoptysis
while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was then
called out to the medical floor where she soon had greater
than 150 cc hemoptysis.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was aggressively attempted that
the patient could not be revived.  Her airway could not be
managed with the blood that was aspirated during her episode
of hemoptysis.  The code was finally called off at 2 am on
[**2145-6-1**] with pronunciation of death secondary to aspiration
from hemoptysis.

In regards to her pulmonary effusion, it was thought that
there was no need for a thoracentesis at this time.  If the
patient was to spike a fever, the Pulmonary team would
consider thoracentesis, however, she never did spike a fever.

2. Infectious Disease:  The patient did have [**4-6**] blood
cultures on [**2145-5-26**] and sputum that grew out MSSA.  She was
initially treated with Vancomycin 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] and continued on
Vancomycin given that she might develop sensitivities to
other types of antibiotics and the fact that she was
tolerating Vancomycin quite well.  Given that her Vancomycin
trough was less than 10, her dosage was increased to 1250 mg
IV bid of the Vancomycin.  A transesophageal echocardiogram
was never done because the patient requested that she have
some time to recover from her hemoptysis.

3. Nonsmall cell lung cancer:  The patient was initially
going to be setup for phototherapy.  However, before this
could be attempted, it was felt that her lung cancer had
eroded into pulmonary arteries leading to the hemoptysis
which eventually led to her death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Death secondary to aspiration from hemoptysis from
nonsmall lung cancer eroding to pulmonary arteries.
2. Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
3. Nonsmall cell lung cancer.

DATE OF DEATH:  [**2145-6-1**] at 2 am.

HOSPITAL  COURSE:  In the ED, the patient received one ampule
of  calcium,  2  grams  of magnesium, 6 liters of fluid.  The
patient   was   treated   with   Levofloxacin,   Flagyl,  and
Hydrocortisone.

The  patient  was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for  management  of  electrolytes.    The  patient  was given
several  ampules of calcium gluconate with improvement of the
free  calcium,  as  well  as the total calcium.  On [**10-11**],  in the morning, the patient admitted to using Dulcolax
on  a daily basis and also frequent use of Fleet Phospho-Soda
enemas  and wanted to make sure that the staff knew that this
could be the possible etiology of her current symptoms.

The  patient  was  continued  to  be hydrated with IV fluids.
Electrolytes  were  repleted.   Calcium continued to improve.
The  patient  was  transferred  to  the floor for management.
Calcium  was then repleted with one gram PO calcium carbonate
with  improvement  of  free  calcium  to a normal range.  All
other  electrolytes were repleted as well.

The  Department of Psychiatry was consulted for evaluation of
the  patient  laxative  abuse.   It was felt that the use was
secondary   to  constipation  and  not  likely  due  to  body
dysmorphic  disorder  or  attempts  to lose weight.  However,
recommend  follow up as an outpatient, which the patient will
do  through  her outpatient therapist, as well as her primary
care  physician,  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  [**Last Name (STitle) **].    The  patient  agrees to use
nonstimulant  bowel regimen, which included Milk of Magnesia,
Colace,  and  Senna.    The  patient  will follow up with the
primary  care  physician  for better bowel regimen management
and  possible  gastrointestinal  follow  up.   At the time of
discharge, the patient's symptoms of tetany and muscle spasms
had completely resolved and the electrolytes were normalized.

2. No pulmonary emboli visualized. No large or central emboli to
account for the patient's hypotension. Subsegmental branches in
right lower lobe not evaluated and, thus, subsegmental emboli in
these areas cannot be excluded. 3. Questionable calcifications
in deep right breast. Note that the [**2131-6-7**] screening
mammogram report describes a wire fragment in the deep slightly
outer right breast.
.
CXR [**12-19**]:  IMPRESSION: Interval slight worsening of bilateral
interstitial and alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary
edema.
.
CXR [**12-22**]:  IMPRESSION: Improvement since prior film with
significant resolution of the pulmonary edema but persistent
interstitial densities and focal opacities at right base, as
described. No pneumothorax.
.
U/S ABD [**12-23**]:  1) Partially distended gallbladder without
cholelithiasis. The gallbladder wall is thickened which could
represent early acute cholecystitis in the correct clinical
setting. A follow-up ultrasound or HIDA scan is recommended if
there is continued clinical concern.
2) Small amount of ascites which is seen tracking around the
gallbladder.
.
TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with  mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve  prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary  artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CTA [**12-30**]:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Pulmonary edema superimposed on a baseline of diffuse
emphysema, with nodular interstitial thickening suggesting
additional superimposed infection. The appearances of the lung,
and specifically, the areas of diffuse interstitial thickening
and pulmonary edema, have worsened significantly since the
examination from [**2131-12-18**]. The dense opacity at the right middle
lobe has improved, although there are new opacities in the
inferior aspects of the lingula and anterior left lower lobe.



Brief Hospital Course:
54yo woman with extensive psychiatric history presented with
RML pnuemonia.

Pneumonia:

- treated empirically for CAP with ceftriaxone/azithromycin
- completed 5 days of vancomycin; d/c after MRSA screen was
negative
- urinary legionella Ag was negative
- serial CXRs showed marked resolution of PNA w/ Abx treatment

Hypotension:

- although low bp at baseline, patient was aggressively
volume resuscitated in the ED and intially started on levophed
to keep MAP > 60.  She was not adrenally insufficient by
cortisol
stimulation testing.  She did not have any positive blood
cultures.
She was quickly weaned from the levophed, and maintained
appropriate
MAP without any pressor support.

Pulmonary Edema:

- developed pulmonary edema after fluid resuscitation,
requiring supplemental oxygen, bipap, and ultimately
intubation for progressive hypoxia and respiratory failure.

- aggressively diuresed with lasix, secondarily developing
metabolic alkalosis that responded to KCl infusion.

- weaned down from AC to Pressure support ventilation;
pressure support weaned, spontaneous breathing trial completed,
and patient was extubated successfully and transferred out of
the unit to the medical floor.  While on the medical floor she
was weaned off supplemental oxygen and was O2satting in mid 90s
on RA

Psych:

- Extensive psychiatric history.  While psychiatric meds were
held on admission, these were added back to her medication
regimen.
She was managed per this regimen with additional prn
anxiolytics.

Abdominal Pain:

-  Pt had some intermittent complaints of abdominal pain that
were pursued with abd ultrasound.  No significant pathology was
elucidated.  Her pain resolved by the time of discharge.

Pertinent Results:
Admission labs:

[**2134-3-1**] CT Abd:
1.  Although the patient's colon has always appeared dilated and
fluid-filled, the distal loops of small bowel on today's study
appear more prominent, and are fluid filled, which does raise
the possibility of new ileus or a distal colonic stricture given
decompression of the distal sigmoid/rectum. The proximal loops
of small bowel are not as dilated, and this is likely due to the
decompression from the nasogastric tube, which is in place.  A
follow up CT study (non-contrast would be sufficient) could be
performed to see if the narrowed area of the sigmoid colon re-
expands.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated
atelectasis.
3.  Bilateral renal cysts.
4.  Prominence of the intrahepatic biliary ducts is stable.
.
[**2134-3-3**] Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
hypokinesis of the basal to mid septum. Hypokinesis is also
suggested in the basal inferior and infero-lateral wall. The
distal segments appear hyperdynamiic with an overall preserved
LVEF (50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal image quality. Basal LV hypokinesis most prominent in
the basal septum. These findings may be consistent with a
non-vascular pattern of LV dysfunction but due to limited image
quality, CAD cannot be excluded.
.
[**2134-3-6**] CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1.  No PE.
2.  Worsening moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.  Enlarging
bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  More consolidative opacity could represent asymmetric
pulmonary edema or atelectasis; however, a superimposed
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
4.  Enlarged new right middle lobe nodule.  Given the rate at
which it has increased in size, an inflammatory process is
favored.  However, attention to this on followup exams is
recommended.
5.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
6.  Severe emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 yo woman with a h/o chronic abdominal pain,
laxative abuse, and chronic diarrhea who was admitted to ICU for
SOB, hypotension, acidemia.
.
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The pt. received aggressive IV
fluid for presumed hypovolemic hypotension. She developed
pulmonary edema presumably from IVF and a component of Left
heart failure.  She was intubated on [**3-3**] for tachypnea and
hypoxia. We diuresed her and her respiratory status improved.
She was extubated on [**3-5**] and did reasonably well on a facemask,
however, later that night she again became hypoxic, tachypnic,
and began to tire and was reextubated. Her fluid status was
significantly positive, so she was started on a lasix gtt. She
was eventually transitioned to pressure, support. Her pulmonary
edema improved and she was extubated on [**3-13**] and did well
thereafter.
.
2. Cardiovascular: The pt. was initially hypotensive. Cardiac
enzymes revealed a troponin leak (0.15) which trending down. An
echo on [**3-3**] showed hypokinesis of the
basal/inferior/inferiolateral wall with an EF of 50%. This was
likely secondary to demand ischemia or an NSTEMI in the setting
of her hypotension. She was started on aspirin 81mg daily.
.
3. Hypotension: The etiology of her hypotension was likely
multifactorial (metabolic, infectious, cardiogenic). On arrival
to the ICU she was given approximately 5L of IVF and started on
levophed and also required vasopressin during her stay. She was
slowly weaned of the vasopressin and levophed, and was taken off
all pressors on the 24th. Her baseline SBP is in the 90's.
.
4. Acidosis: likely secondary to chronic diarrhea and vomiting.
Pt. was given sodium bicarbonate to correct here acidosis.
.
5. Abdominal Pain: The patient has chronic abdominal pain,
however she developed acute abdominal pain which looked to be an
illeus on CT scan there was also concern for an SBO. Initially,
she was followed by surgery for possible intervention for an
SBO. GI was also following. NGT and rectal tube were placed for
decompression. Her illeus eventually resolved without surgical
intervention. She was started on tube feeds and transitioned to
a regular diet. The rectal tube and NGT were removed.
.
6. Hyperkalemia: The required large amounts of potassium
repletion during her ICU stay, secondary to correcting of her
acidosis and lasix doses.
.
7. Hyponatremia: Pt. was hypovolemic hyponatremic on
presentation. Her hyponatremia improved with NS.
.
8. ID: Pt. was initially started on vanc, flagyl, cipro for
empiric broad coverage. Cultures were sent. She had a e.coli UTI
(cipro resistent) and was started on a 10 day course of
ceftrioxone. She had GM+ cocci which was covered by vancomycin
and azithromycin for atypical coverage.
.
9. Anemia: Her anemia studies were consistent with anemia of
chronic disease. She received 2u of pRBCS during her stay.
.
10. COPD: She is a current [**Month/Year (2) 1818**]. Nebs were given throughout
her stay.
.
11. Psych: patient was on extensive psych regimen. We restarted
all of her psych meds during stay except adderall, which was
held until discharge.  She was given ativan as needed.
.
12. Nutrition: initially she was slowing started on tube feeds.
When her ileus resolved, her diet was advanced to fulls as
tolerated.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 58 year old female with
history of COPD, Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar disease,
Borderline Personality Disorder, severe pain, depression, RA,
and oxygen use (4L without a clear-cut rationale).  She was
admitted today for chest pain and dyspnea.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports that she had the flu last week and began
experiencing diffuse chest pain (10+/10), a non-productive
cough, fatigue, and pain-associated dyspnea over the weekend
that differed in quality from her normal angina.  The pain
intensitifed when she would breath deeply or cough and she had a
reported fever of 102.0, and she denied chills/sweats as well as
any radiating pain to her neck or arms.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] did not take
her usual nitroglycerin, but instead called Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**], her pulmonologist who directed her to get a CXR at
the ED.  Medical records indicate that she described her chest
pain to EMT as left-sided, stabbing, associated with pressure
and dyspnea -- similiar to her normal angina-like symptoms.  Ms.
[**Known lastname **], however, disputes this characterization (along with
receiving any pain medications en-route or in the ED.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also reports a worsening of her chronic diarhrea since
[**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**1-19**].  She also reports that some blood in her
diarrhea since that time, but denies any change in her PO
intake, reporting that she had a proper dinner last night.
.
In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 3728**] vitals were BP: 115/63 & 102/53, HR: 107 &
90, RR: 16 & 20, O2 Sat: 100% 5L NC & 94% on 3L NC.  She was
also afebrile.  In the ED she received ASA (325 mg),
Nitroglycerin, Kcl (40mEq), Percocet (5/325), morphine (2mg IV),
and Levofloxacin (750mg).  She denied any abdominal pain and
refused a guaiac exam.  On physical exam, no wheezing.  A CXR
identified multifocal bilateral airspace opacities and blunting
of the left costophrenic angle -- consistent with multifocal
pneumonia and a small parapneumonic effusion.  Her EKG was
reassuring, and her cardiac enzymes (CK: 21) were negative. She
also had no events on telemetry and was reportedly chest pain
free before being transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **].
.
After being transferred to [**Doctor Last Name **], she complained of chest pain
and dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pain in the balls of her feet.
She also refused rectal guiac as well as an ABG.  A second CXR
indicated that her cardiac sillihette was stable, that she had
multifocal pneumonia with multifocal hazy opacities in her RUL,
RML, and LLL as well as a blunted left costrophrenic angle.

IMAGES:

STRESS ECHO ([**1-25**]) Poor functional exercise capacity. No ischemic
ECG changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of possible prior
myocardial infarction without inducible ischemia at the limited
achieved workload. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures
were normal before and after exercise.

CXR ([**2-28**]; am) FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were
obtained. The cardiac silhouette is stable in appearance. There
is prominence of the right paratracheal stripe which is new
compared to the prior study and may reflect mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. There are multifocal hazy opacities noted
within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower
lobe. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
suggestive of a small pleural effusion. The osseous structures
are intact. IMPRESSION: Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities
and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, the appearance of
which is consistent with multifocal pneumonia and a
small parapneumonic effusion. Interval development of prominence
of the right paratracheal stripe which may reflect reactive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A follow up CXR is recommended
following treatment.

CXR ([**2-28**];pm) FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained
with patient in semi-upright position demonstrates again the on
next previous examination demonstrated multifocal parenchymal
densities in the pulmonary parenchyma preferentially in the
right upper lobe and left mid lung field and left lung base.
They persist practically unaltered. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax, and the lateral
pleural sinuses are only mildly blunted. Review of the next
preceding chest examination of [**2136-2-8**] showed
remarkable absence of any significant parenchymal densities at
that time. IMPRESSION: Bilateral multifocal extensive pulmonary
infiltrates consistent
with inflammatory processes. In light of patient's previous
diagnosis of COPD, consider also possibility of atypical edema
in particular as patient received large dose of fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year old female with history of COPD on 2-4L home
O2, Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar and Borderline Personality
Disorder admitted [**2135-2-27**] for chest pain and dyspnea after 5
days of viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and
respiratory distress.

1) Chest Pain/Dyspnea:  Patient has history of systolic CHF and
COPD - although according to pulm notes may not be obstructive
and may not actually need O2. At home on 4L NC at all times.
Reportes that chest pain differs from her usual anginal chest
pain and hurts more with deep breaths and coughing.   In
addition, her EKG and cardiac enzyme levels suggested that a
myocardial infarction was not the source of her symptoms.
Likely her symptoms were caused by PNA (bibasilar multifocal
opacities on 2 CXRs) and exacerbated by getting fluids in the ED
(2L NS). Also, may in part, be attributed to anxiety as patient
has extensive psych history.  Levo (750mg) was provided in the
ED and scheduled for [**2136-3-1**]. Upon arrival to the floor she
triggered immediately for low o2 sats on 4L NC and tachycardia.
She was put on venti mask and sats came up. It was felt she had
pulm edema given IVF in ED and CXR with possible edema. She
continued with tachycardia and it was thought this was a
combination of the CHF with BNP 8000 (highest in [**Month/Day/Year **] only 800s),
respiratory distress, and anxiety. She may also have taken her
home medications including adderall. Her room was searched and
these were taken from her. Got total of 30mg IV lasix over the
course of the late afternoon/evening as well as ativan and her
home dose of clonipin. HR came down to 120s. Overnight she
continued to have tachypnea with recurrently low O2 sats on 6L
NC so was placed on venti-mask. She continued to be tachycardic
all night with no improvement after ativan and confiscating her
adderall which she had been hiding in her room. An ABG revealed
hypoxia (PO2 61) without CO2 retention. She was given an extra
10mg IV lasix and put out total of 2.3L over the night.
 In the am she continued to be tachypnic, hypoxic, and
tachycardic. She was started on IV vanc for empiric coverage of
HAP given recent hospitalizations. A repeat CXR did not show
pulm edema so no further lasix was given. She was started on
BIPAP. Repeat ABG with PO2 50s. She was transferred to the MICU
for respiratory distress and possible intubation. Of note she
did say she would take intubation ""as a last resort"". Would not
give us the phone numbers of next of [**Doctor First Name **] and in [**Name (NI) **] sister's
number is out of service.
 She was transferred to the MICU where she was stabilized after
briefly being on BIPAP. A speech and swallow evaluation
confirmed that she was aspirating. The MICU team discussed with
her placing a PEG tube and she refused. She also pulled out an
NGT placed for feeding two times.
  She came back to the floor and was satting 94% on 2L NC which
is her baseline. We attempted to convince her to comply with a
video swallow exam to rule out silent aspiration but the patient
refused. Given that she was high aspiration risk it was felt
that she should not eat, however, the patient threatened to
leave the hospital if she was not given food. Therefore, after
explaining her risk of choking and developing further
pneumonias, a compromise was reached. The patient had a
nectar-thickened diet while in house. She was set up with an
outpatient speech and swallow evaluation (including video
swallow) which she said she would comply with as long as we did
not try to evaluate her in the hospital. She was discharged with
""Thick-aid"" to add to her liquids and will see the speech and
swallow team in one week for her evaluation. Her primary care
doctor will discuss these results with her.

2) Anemia:  Patient with history of chronic inflammation (RA) as
well as gastritis likely from NSAIDs reports both bright and
dark blood in stool starting on [**Name (NI) 2974**]; attributes blood, in
part, to internal and external hemmorhoids and refused rectal
guiac on mulitple occasions.  Normal MCV, low Fe, low TIBC, low
tranferrin and high ferritin suggestive of anemia of chronic
disease which is associated with both chronic inflammatory
processes and heart failure.  Patient may be suffering from ACD
along with co-existing iron deficiency, requiring both iron
supplementation as well as addressing her underlying disorder.
Stool guaiacs were negative on the floor. Patient was consented
for blood transfusion but was not transfused given volume
overload and stable hcts while on floor.
 In the MICU she was given 1unit pRBCs for a slightly lower hct
than previously. Her hct continued to be stable throughout her
stay. Her naproxen was held throughout her stay and she was
started on iron which she will take as an outpatient. Her
primary care doctor will follow her blood counts as an
outpatient.

3) Diarrhea: Patient has chronic history of diarrhea with a
question of laxative abuse and anorexia; Had some loose stools
on the floor even after medications were comfiscated and with
recent hospitalizations may have an infection. CDiff tests were
negative.

4) Pain Management/Psych issues: Unclear who is following her
for psych as an outpatient. Will likely need psych consult at
some point given medication regimen is likely not correct
regimen and she has off and on been refusing medical care.
Currently does have capacity per the medicine floor team's
assessment but may need formal capacity assessment in the
future. Also has h/o eating disorders and with laxative abuse
may need eating disorder team consult when more acute medical
issues resolved.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old female with past medical history
significant for Bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, multiple suicide attempts, h/o alcoholism, PTSD, COPD
on home O2, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy who presented to ED via
EMS after being found disoriented and wandering around her
housing complex barefoot with 1 empty and 1 full bottle of
clonazepam. She had 1 empty bottle of clonazepam filled [**7-14**]
with 0 tablets and a 2nd bottle of clonazepam filled with 39
pills (filled yesterday, so 21 tablets gone). She is supposed to
be taking up to 4 pills per day per [**Month/Year (2) **]. Patient states on
further history that she dropped ""a bunch"" of her clonazepam
tablets fell on the floor. She repeatedly denies any overdose.

She was initially very agitated and unable to give detailed
history. She also c/o pain all over her body pain and was
slightly tremulous at rest. Per patient, she also complained of
having recently run out of her home 02 a ""few days ago"" which
she takes for history of COPD.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 100.1, HR 83, BP 116/86,
RR 20 and O2 sat 99% 2L . She denied fevers, cough, dysuria or
abdominal pains on ROS in ED. She was a limited historian
however, and difficult as she refused FSG and refused attempt at
LP. Despite negative ETOH level she claims she has been drinking
a bottle of wine daily but also made several confusing
statements about timeline of her ETOH use so it is unclear if
she actively using alcohol now. CT head and CXR in ED were both
negative. EKG also showed normal intervals, NSR with no
concerning ST changes. While in ED, she received 1.5L NS IVFs.
2mg Ativan, 5mg Haldol and 50mg Benadryl for agitation which
slowly improved through the afternoon. She was also given 1x
dose 2g Ceftriaxone to cover possible urinary source and
meningitis per ED resident although given no headaches and
normal neuro exam there was limited concern for meningitis as
her AMS improved in the ED.

Given notice of recent TSH of 50 that has been untreated an
endocrinology consult was also called from [**Location **] and patient was
given 200mcg IV levothyroxine. Per report, endocrinology service
did not feel she was in overt myxedema coma but felt her
metabolism of recent drugs likely impaired given her severe
hypothyroidism.

On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initial vital signs were: T 99.3F, BP
107/58, HR 77, RR 22 and O2 sat 98% on 2L NC. She seemed mildly
confused and very easily agitated and refused to answer multiple
questions. In no apparent distress.

ECG [**2137-7-28**]: Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, likely left
ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2137-4-6**] findings are
similar.

[**2137-7-28**] CXR PORTABLE AP:
INDICATION: 60-year-old female with altered mental status.

COMPARISON: [**2137-6-5**].

CHEST, AP: The lungs are clear, other than some mild
retrocardiac
atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. There are no pleural effusions. No acute fractures are
identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2137-7-28**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large areas
of edema,
large masses or mass effect. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
is preserved.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. Mucosal thickening/mucous retention cyst is noted
within the left maxillary sinus.  Otherwise, the visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Visualized
soft tissues of the orbits and nasopharynx are within normal
limits.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
60yo F with h/o bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, PTSD, fibromyalgia, multiple suicide attempts, COPD on
home O2, cervical neck fracture (in chronic brace), and severe
OA who presents with altered mental status after questionable
overdose.

Questionable Overdose/AMS: Head CT in ED was within normal
limits and neuro exam also non-focal. No evidence of infection,
the patient also admits to ETOH so her initial presentation
could have been withdrawal and seizure but no witnessed seizure
activity and ETOH serum negative (although w/d obviously still
would be possible in the setting of neg ETOH).  The patient was
found to be unresponsive in the setting of an open klonopin
bottle on the floor, although the patient adamantly denied a
suidcide attempt this was still a very likely possibility as she
was on multiple sedating medications and no other organic cause
for change in level of consciousness could be found.  In
addition patient improved with time / medication washout.

BIPOLAR DISORDER: The patient was on multiple psychotropic
medications.  These were held inpt, risperdal 1mg po qhs was
started back while inpatient. The patient is medically cleared
for discharge to a psychiatric facility.

HYPONATREMIA: She had dilute urine but admits to taking in large
amounts of water, hypothyroidism also a likely contributer.  1
liter free H2O restriction and levothyroxine.

COPD: no active flare. continue low flow 2-3L O2 via nasal
cannula for O2 sats >90% goal, on home O2.

Fever: Unclear etiology. Also has an elevated WBC to 17 with 85%
PMN shift. CXR with no clear infiltrates. She has fairly normal
UA despite complaints of dysuria ""off and on"". No abdominal pain
but does mention recent diarrhea. Lactate is WNL at 1.6 and
patient has stable vitals throughout hospitalization.  2 days of
afebrile prior to discharge.

Hypothyroidism: Endocrine consulted, continue levothyroxine
50mcg daily and recheck TSH in 6 weeks.

Cervical spine fracture (in chronic brace):
--continue soft neck brace
--pain control with lidocaine patch
--Tylenol PRN (serum tox acetominophen level negative)

Mild systolic CHF: last EF 45% back in [**2136-1-19**]. Written for
home dose of 40mg PO BID lasix. Seems dry on exam and states she
has been having diarrhea for few days.  Continue lasix 40mg po
daily and follow up as outpatient.

History of Present Illness:
64 yo AA male with HIV/AIDS (VL: 570; CD4: 251 on [**11-27**]'[**48**]
currently treated with Combivir and Bactrim SS Mon, Wed, Fri for
ppx as well as a flu shot for [**2147**]-[**2148**]) and COPD on home oxygen
(FEV1/FVC: 34%; FEV1 26%; FVC: 77%) comes in with dyspnea for 6
days. The pt reports development of sob similar to his previous
episodes of COPD/PNA. 2-3days ago, he subsequently developed
cough productive of yellow-green sputum along with subjective
fevers, chills, and diaphoresis. He also developed some
pleuritic chest pain several days ago. The chest pain was
located in the left side of the chest below the nipple line and
occurred with deep inspiration. The pt reports these are all
similar to previous episodes of COPD exacerbation. The pt had
tried nebulizers Q4hours in addition to 2L NC one day PTA
without any improvement. The pt uses oxygen at home 40% of the
time, mostly when he is active. The pt noted inc. DOE even with
the oxygen prior to this episode. The pt does admit to one
episode of vomiting in the ED, which was thought to be secondary
to meds he received in the ED. The pt denies HA, abd pain,
diarrhea.


In the ED, the pt was febrile to 101 rectally, requiring 5liters
oxygen to keep sats >96%. He was given ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, bactrim and solumedrol with continuouos nebs for
PNA vs. COPD flare. He had one episode of emesis in ED. The pt
also received a CTA which ruled out a PE (given the concern for
pleuritic chest pain). ABG in the ED was: 7.44/40/81-->
7.49/40/67. The pt reports improvement in his sob after
receiving solumedrol and nebs in the ED.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] is a 67M with HIV (Cd4 183, VL 96 copies/mL) and end
stage COPD on 3-4L home O2 with a FEV1 of 0.5 who presented to
the emergency room on [**2152-2-15**] with increased shortness of
breath. Three days prior to presentation he developed nasal
congestion and rhinorrhea which made it difficult for him to use
his supplemental oxygen at home. He had subjective fevers and
chills but did not check his temperature. He had minimal cough
productive of dark yellow sputum. He was feeling more short of
breath despite increasing oxygen use. He was concerned about
pneumonia and presented to the emergency room.
.
In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 98.1 HR: 86 RR:
107/72 RR: 22 O2: 100% on RA. He had a chest xray which showed
significant hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
He received levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, duonebs, solumedrol 125
mg IV x 1 and aspirin 81 mg. He was initially admitted to the
floor.
.
While on the floor he was started on azithromycin, solumedrol
125 mg IV TID, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers. He did well
on hospital day 1 but overnight his shortness of breath
worsened. He had a repeat CXR which was similar to priors. He
had an ABG on a non-rebreather which was 7.37/57/207/34. He had
increased work of breathing and asked to be placed on ""a machine
for breathing."" He is transferred to the MICU for non-invasive
ventilatory support.
n the MICU he was intubated an an A-line was placed due to
increased
WOB. Blood pressure was elevated while in respiratory distress
and he was treated with hydralazine. He had one episode of
hypotension responsive to IVF. A right IJ central line placed.
ABG on [**2-18**] was 7.32/54/104. Methylprednisolone was decreased to
60mg IV BID. He was extubated on ICU day 3 and initially
appeared in stress but did well after small dose IV morphine.He
was transferred to the floor on ICU day 4. Prior to transfer he
reviewed his code status and decided to be DNR/DNI.
.
On the floor, he is doing relatively well. He reports he is
still somewhat short of breath but not in any distress. He
reports back pain secondary to old back injury. He will be
spending time with family and friends who are coming in from
around the country to see him. Reports lack of appetite but no
n/v. Denies F/C cough, chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] is a 67M with HIV (on HAART) and
end-stage COPD (on home O2), who presented [**2152-2-15**] with
worsening shortness of breath in the setting of likely [**Hospital 2170**]
transferred to MICU for worsening respiratory distress.
.
# End-stage COPD/Respiratory Distress: End-stage baseline COPD
(FEV1 20% predicted and on home O2). Admitted w likely COPD
exacerbation triggered by viral URI. Nasal complaints and
absence of infiltrate go against a bacterial PNA. MI and PE also
considered. Pt treated with nebulizers, steroids, azithromycin.
ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which appears
compensated. Pt oxygenated well on O2 by nasal canula, but
developed respiratory distress w accessory muscle use, tachypnea
and tachycardia, which required MICU transfer on [**2-17**] for
increasing respiratory distress.  He was subsequently intubated
that same night as his respiratory status continued to worsen.
He remained stable on the vent and was extubated without
complications on [**2-19**].  His respiratory status continued to be
stable post-extubation.  He was continued on azithromycin for a
three day course and continued on steroids.  He was then
transferred back to the medical floor the following day after
extubation with stable respiratory status.  Followed by Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 2171**].  On the floor his steroid regimen was kept as IV until
patient's SBO resolved.  With resolution of SBO patient was
transitioned to PO steroids.  Pt was discharged with a steroid
taper.  His last dose of Prednisone 10mg [**3-6**].
.
On the floor his dyspnea continued and he required 4-5 L of
nasal O2. He was evaluated by palliative care after he made the
decision to become DNR/DNI. Based on their recommendations he
was switched from ATC morphine to MS contin and ativan for
dyspnea related anxiety. He was noted to have mental status
changes including confusion, somnolence so MS contin was
discontinued with return to normal mentation. His respiratory
continued to improve with decrease in anxiety noted.  Patient's
pain was well controlled with liquid morphine, fentanyl patch,
and tylenol #3 as needed.
.
# HIV/AIDS: Patient on HAART with recent decrease in CD4 count
to below 200, hence on bactrim ppx. Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**]. HAART
was temporarily discontinued in the setting of SBO with nausea
and vomiting. With resolution of SBO, HAART was restarted on
[**2152-2-29**].
.
#Small bowel obstruction: Patient developed acutely worsening
abdominal pain on the [**Hospital1 **] associated with nausea and vomiting.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a partial SBO. He was
made NPO and a nasogastric tube was placed.  Patient's nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal distention improved steadily.  His NGT
was clamped and eventually discontinued on [**2-28**] with advancement
of his diet to a regular diet.  He tolerated that well.
.
#Pneumonia: Patient was found to have a left lower lobe
pneumonia incidentally on chest xray evaluating PICC placement.
Labs at the time were remarkable for leukocytosis. He was
started on Zosyn and vancomycin for presumed Hospital associated
pneumonia.  Patient's vancomycin was stopped on [**2-27**].  He was
continued on Zosyn and then transitioned to PO levoquin on [**2-29**]
and discharged on this medication to complete an 8 day course of
antibiotics with last day of antibiotics to be [**2152-3-4**].
.
# Hypertension: Normotensive on admission, mild elevation in
blood pressures in the setting of respiratory distress.  Patient
was continued on his home dose of doxazosin while in house.
.
# GERD: Stable. Continued H2 blocker.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit dropped slightly during hospital admission
from patient's baseline of 36 to 22.  Iron studies demonstrated
most likely anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia
coupled with dilutional effect of IV hydration and daily blood
draws as reasonable explanation of drop in hematocrit.  Patient
was always hemodynamically stable with no signs or symptoms of
active bleeding.  Patient was started on PO Iron.

History of Present Illness:
69 yo M h/o HIV, COPD presenting with shortness of breath and
""not feeling well."" He was notably just admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for a
COPD exacerbation [**Date range (1) 2178**]. During this admission he was noted to
have a tenuous respiratory status with poor air movement and was
briefly intubated for a few hours. He was started on steroids
with a slow taper and azithromycin. Since his discharge he did
not feel well and came to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 103 170/105 27 99% 3L. He was
noted to have poor air movement and given 125 mg IV solumedrol
and duonebs. BiPAP started, however patient vomited, so this was
stopped. He was given IV zofran and phenergan. ABG was
7.37/58/96, so once his nausea resolved, he was placed back on
BiPap. He was notably tachycardic to the 180s which was felt to
be afib vs. MAT. He was given 15 mg IV diltiazem and broke soon
after this. He was notably also given morphine and ativan. CXR
notable for hyperinflation. Vitalls prior to transfer:: 101
189/109 21 100% Bipap.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was taken off of BiPAP due

Chest X-Ray:
1. Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with known diagnosis of COPD.
2. Stable right calcified lymph node.
3. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle
with preserved systolic function. Small and hyperdynamic left
ventricle. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2148-9-24**], RV is now mildly dilated and appears
hypertrophied. The other findings are probably similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M h/o HIV on HAART, COPD on home oxygen, and remote
history of left leg DVT p/w worsening dyspnea after recent
discharge from OSH for COPD.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely COPD exacerbation. Patient has history of
severe emphysema and bronchiectasis. FEV1: 20% in spirometry
[**2150**] c/w end stage disease.  Patient was intermittently treated
with BIPAP in ICU, however his oxygen saturation was good and he
often requested BIPAP for only short amounts of time prior to
removing BIPAP. Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] was started on Methylprednisolone 125
mg IV Q6H for the first day of admission and then was
transitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily.  He will continue on a
slow prednisone taper.  He was also treated with a 5 day course
of levofloxacin 750 mg.  Patient was treated with duonebs and
received ativan and oxycodone for dyspnea.  He was started on
bactrim, famotidine, and calc/vit D for prophylaxis for presumed
long term steroids.
.
# Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Patient was noted to have
multifocal atrial tachycardia ED, resolved prior to admission to
ICU. Likley secondary to underlying COPD.  Patient's COPD was
controlled and he did not have multifocal atrial tachycardia
while in ICU.  Diltiazem was started at 30mg TID for HR control
with HRs < 100.
.
# HTN: Patient with elevated SBPs.  He was started on PO
diltiazem as above and continued on doxazosin.
.
# H/O DVT: Patient was diagnosed with DVT in [**2152-3-17**].
Reportedly completed coumadin course per Dr.[**Name (NI) 2179**] note in
the past, however was continued due to sedentary life. On
admission, patient had sub-therpeutic INR.  Patient was started
on SQH and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  He was continued on
coumadin at home dose.  He requires daily INR levels as we are
initiating bactrim therapy, coumadin should be adjusted as seen
fit to maintain INR between [**12-20**].
.
# HIV: Last CD4 count 247. Continued home HAART regimen.
.
# Hypernatremia: On presentation to ED.  Improved with IVF.
.

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPap
Intubation, extubation ([**2154-4-13**])


History of Present Illness:
69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD
(2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.
The patient had been recently admitted 5/13-16/[**2153**] for COPD
exacerbation and treated with nebs, azithromycin, prednisone
(slow taper). The patient presented to the ED on [**2154-4-2**] for
dyspnea but left AMA before admission. He was sent to the ED on
[**2154-4-8**] but left AMA again, with prednisone and azithromycin
prescriptions which he never filled. He had seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
pulmonary clinic yesterday and had been non-compliant with
prednisone taper. He endorsed ""exhaustion"" at the appointment
but was stable 93% on 3.5L nasal cannula. The patient had also
been at [**Hospital **] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2185**] prior to Pulmonary
appointment.
.
The patient re-presented to the ED today with worsening dyspnea
and was brought in by EMS in respiratory distress (enroute CO2
50). He responded to nebulizers enroute and arrived looking very
uncomfortable, using accessory muscles. He was tight on
pulmonary exam with minimal breath sounds and speaking few word
sentences. The patient was started on BiPap (50%, PSV 15, PEEP
5), which he tolerated well. He was briefly weaned off to 4L NC
but decompensated, tripoding despite Methylprednisolone 125mg IV
X1, Azithromycin 500mg, more nebulizers and ativan 2mg IV.
.
ROS: Patient denies fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, myalgias,
changes in bowel movement or urination.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD
(2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.

.
# Respiratory Distress: Most likely due to ongoing COPD
exacerbation. Trigger unclear given lack of pneumonia on initial
CXR, no fevers/chills, productive cough. Patient has been
non-compliant with medications, however, since discharge; this
includes prednisone and antibiotics. ?compliance with nebulizers
and has supplemental O2 at home. The patient has had CTA
recently to rule out pulmonary emboli given ongoing dyspnea
despite therapy. He was treated with azithromycin for 5 days and
methylprednisolone. He intermittently required BiPap. A plan was
made to use bipap at night once the patient was able to leave
the ICU. However on the morning of [**4-13**] patient was anxious,
tachypneic and desatted and required intubation.  The patient
was extubated on [**4-14**]. He did well overnight but subsequently
had further respiratory distress and his steroids were increased
to full burst.  He ultimately decided to be DNR/DNI and came to
the understanding that he wasn't going to get better; the
patient decided to become CMO and was discharged to home hospice
after discussing with Palliative Care in-house.
- Continue long steroid taper at home (Prednisone 60mg X 7 days,
40mg X 7 days, 20 mg X7 days, 10mg X 7 days, off)
- Continue supplemental oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebs
- Continue MS contin and morphine liquid PRN for air hunger,
shortness of breath
- Continue lorazepam PRN for air hunger, shortness of breath,
anxiety
.
# HIV: Down trending CD4 count, ?due to acute illness. Continued
abacavir, lamivudine, fosamprenavir, and atazanavir. Continued
Bactrim SS daily. Patient does have history of Bactrim needing
to be held in [**10/2153**] for bone marrow suppression. The need for
ongoing HAART medication and PCP prophylaxis was discussed with
the patient. It was felt that he likely will not succumb to
HIV/AIDS or an opportunistic infection before he succumbs to his
end-stage COPD. However, taking these medications are not a
hardship for the patient and he would prefer not to risk
increasing HIV viral load and chance of opportunistic infection,
especially in the setting of ongoing steroids.
- The patient will be discharged home on hospice with
continuation of his HAART medications and Bactrim PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# DVT: LENI the day prior to admission as outpatient was
negative for DVT. Patient has been therapeutic and followed by
[**Hospital3 **] here at [**Company 191**]. He missed several doses of
Coumadin in the settting of being on Bipap and developed a
subtherapeutic INR. He was bridged with Lovenox. Anticoagulation
held [**4-13**] for concern for GIB but coumadin was resumed when hct
was stable for 24 hrs. Upon discharge home with hospice,
however, anticoagulation was discussed with the patient. As he
had a DVT in [**2152-3-17**] and ultimately completed treatment but was
continued given his sedentary/immobile nature, the indication
for ongoing anticoagulation and risk of DVT/PE is not high.
- Given this information, the patient chose to be discharged off
of coumadin. His primary care provider and the [**Name9 (PRE) 191**]
anticoagulation nurses were informed of his decision, and the
fact that he no longer needs INR checks.
.
#GIB: Patient noted to have guaic positive stool. T+S sent, PPI
started, PICC placed, transfused 1 unit of blood but did not
bump appropriately, so given 2nd unit. Hct then increased
appropriately and remained stable.
- PPI was stopped given the absence of frank melena on discharge
and to minimize medications for hospice.
.
# Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Seen in the ED during patient's
hospitalization [**2154-3-28**]. Patient was started on diltiazem in
this setting but did not have MAT last admission either. The
patient can continue on home diltiazem on discharge to prevent
discomfort from breakthrough tachycardia.
.
# Anemia: Slightly lower than baseline Hct close to 30.
Normocytic and previously thought due to chronic disease. HAART
medications may be contributing to marrow suppression. In
addition, pt noted to have guaic positive stools which are
discussed above.
.
# Hypertension: Stable, mildly hypertensive, continued [**Last Name (un) **]
diltiazem and doxazosin. -- doxazosin was stopped on discharge
for hospice to streamline medications.
.
# Osteoporosis: On Calcium and Vitamin D.
- These medications were stopped on discharge to streamline
medications.
.
# GERD: Admitted on famotidine. Stable, started on PPI as above
while intubated as famotidine can also interact with HIV
medications; also in setting of guaiac positive stools per
above.
- Famotidine was stopped on discharge to streamline medications.
.
# Other transitional issues:
- Continue home O2 as prescribed
- Oral suction as prescribed
- Maintain PICC with appropriate heparin flushes as a provision
for morphine infusion if patient's air hunger is refractory to
PO morphine elixir and he requires IV morphine

[**2128-1-11**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA
showed a 40% tapering distal stenosis, which did not
angiographically
appear to be flow-limiting. The LAD showed a 60% proximal and
90%
midsegment stenosis. The LCX showed a 90% proximal stenosis
followed by
a 100% distal segment stenosis. The RCA showed mild diffuse
calcified
disease in the proximal and mid segments with a 100% stenosis in
the
posterolateral branch just distal to the right posterior
descending
artery, with left to right collaterals filling the distal right
posterolateral branch artery. The right acute marginal artery
showed a
100% stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography did not adequately visualize the
ventricular
lumen due to insufficient contrast volume. The LVEF was
approximately
50% with posterobasal akinesis and [**2-9**]+ mitral regurgitation.
3. Limited left-sided hemodynamics demonstrated severely
elevated left
ventricular end-diastolic pressures of 25 mmHg, suggestive of
severe
diastolic dysfunction.

[**2128-1-15**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. There are Q waves in the
inferior leads
consistent with prior infarction. Low voltage. Compared to the
previous tracing voltage has decreased.

[**2128-1-12**] ECHO
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferolateral and basal lateral
with apical hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation present.
6.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2128-1-11**] for further
management of his chest pain and EKG changes. Heparin and
aspirin were continued without chest pain. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel
disease, [**2-9**]+ mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of
50%. Integrilin was started. Given the severity of his disease,
the cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. As he elevated blood sugars, the [**Last Name (un) 387**]
diabetes service was consulted for assistance with his
management. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an
ejection fraction of 40%, no mitral regurgitation, normal aortic
valve and diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis. Integrilin was
discontinued in preparation for cardiac surgery. On [**2128-1-15**], Mr.
[**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin and beta
blockade were resumed. He developed atrial fibrillation which
converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockade and
amiodarone. Later on postoperative day two, he was transferred
to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His drains and pacing wires
were removed without issue. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative six. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lung cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x3
PleurX catheter insertion
Emergent intubation


History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 83 year old female with small cell lung
cancer who was accepted in transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Patient is with known right small cell lung cancer undergoing
chemotherapy/radiation therapy at [**Hospital3 1563**] [**Hospital3 **]. She
now presents with acute respiratory falure and is status-post
intubation. The reports from the outside hospital indicate
extrinsic compression from right mainstem bronchus obstructing
the proximal airway now with complete collapse of the right
hemithorax with partial collapse of the left hemithroax. CT
scans from [**Hospital1 1562**] indicate a large volume tumor encasing the
right lung. The patient's family was advised of her dismal
prognosis, and the patient was admitted for the possibility of a
meaningful intervention with the goal of palliative therapy.

Past Medical History:
End stage small cell lung canger with known brain metastasis
Now s/p chemo/radiation therapy
Breast cancer
X-Ray therapy pneumonitis
COPD
Osteoporosis

CTA on the left, minimal breath sounds on the right
Abdomen soft, NT/ND
Extremeties with 1+ edema, no cyanosis

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a
bronchoscopy on [**2163-11-11**]. This revealed a completely obstructed
right upper lobe with tumor and submucosal infiltration of the
proximal right mainstem bronchus. Post-bronchoscopy, a chest
xray showed partial re-expansion of the right lower lobe. The
patient was placed on a CPAP trial the next morning, which she
passed. She was extubated for a period of a few hours. However,
due to increasing respiratory effort, the patient soon fatigued,
and required emergent re-intubation. The patient was fully
conscious at this time, and willingly indicated a desire to be
re-intubated. A repeat chest xray showed a re-accumulation of
fluid in the right hemithorax with collase of the right lower
lobe. The patient was kept intubated and on supportive care
until [**2163-11-15**], when the patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy
and placement of a PleurX catheter on the right. This was done
in the hopes that the patient could be extubated once the
pleural effusion was cleared. However, the patient failed to
properly wean off the vent. Following on-going dialogue with the
patient's family, it was decided that the patient would be made
comfort measures only on [**2163-11-20**]. The patient was extubated and
expired several hours later.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for right upper lobe small
cell cancer stage III, status post chemotherapy and
radiation, status post right upper lobe sleeve resection
[**6-19**], also with past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer status post radical
prostatectomy, GERD, TIA 15 years ago, gout and COPD. The
patient has no known drug allergies.  The patient is status
post right upper lobe lung sleeve resection on [**6-19**] for small
cell lung cancer.  The patient was discharged home doing well
until four days prior to admission when he presented to the
Emergency Room with shortness of breath and fevers.  The
patient was given Levaquin and was then discharged home
again.  He continued having shortness of breath and
productive cough.  He was admitted [**7-11**] for a follow-up
bronchoscopy during which time they found a right middle lobe
obstruction secondary to swelling.  After the procedure the
patient had shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of
88 as well as rigors and chills.  The patient was also found
to have poor color.  The patient's O2 saturation improved.
Chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was admitted.  The
patient underwent surgery [**2175-7-15**].  The patient underwent
completion pneumonectomy, bronchoscopy and serratus flap
closure of right main stem bronchus.

Postoperative day #1 the patient was afebrile with heart rate
of 56, blood pressure 104/56, satting at 99%.  Chest tube

38.5, platelet count 394,000, potassium 4.8, BUN 13,
creatinine .6 with glucose of 188, magnesium 1.8 and CPK of
1410.  Plan was to wean the oxygen and check an ABG later on
and continue the pneumonectomy tube.  To check an EKG because
of the EKG change this morning in which patient had ST
segment elevations, undergo rule out MI protocol.

Postoperative day #2 the patient had no events over the last
24 hours, patient remained afebrile.  Heart rate 60, normal

pending.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to administer
Lasix today after transfer to the floor.  Infectious disease
came by to see the patient postop day #2 as well because they
were requested to recommend an antibiotic for the right
infiltrate to prevent the possibility of a postoperative
empyema.  Their recommendation was to continue with the
current IV antibiotics.  Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone will be
present. In the remote chance of postoperative infection
empyema these antibiotics will be present in the cavity and
also by peripheral circulation.

Postoperative day #3, events over the last 24 hours include
atrial fibrillation.  Patient mildly febrile at 99.2, heart
rate 57 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 102/42, respirations

331,000, INR 1.1, PTT  28, potassium 3.9, BUN 14, creatinine
.5, glucose 141.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to
check the PT, PTT and to get a chest x-ray today and to
continue 20 mg of Lasix.  ID came by to see the patient again
today at which time they stated that the patient is already
on broad coverage for the lung abscess.  Strep and staff
improving, the tubes will be discontinued after the
antibiotics.  Follow-up of sensitivities on the culture and
anticipate a three week course of antibiotics.

PTT of 28.  Physical exam unremarkable.  The day prior the
patient underwent a spiral CT of the chest to rule out a PE.
There was radiographic evidence for peripheral pulmonary
emboli in the left lung, patient on Heparin.  ID again came
by to see the patient at which time they stated that the
patient was clinically stable from an ID perspective and to
continue the antibiotic regimen for a total of 14 days.  If
the patient spikes a fever they were to be consulted again.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man
with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status
post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this
year, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for respiratory failure.  Two weeks prior to
admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of
shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  Echocardiogram and
electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly
unremarkable.

On [**2175-9-17**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the
patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and
collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe.
His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the
field and taken to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was
reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new
left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through
V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which
was new.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation
and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.
2.  Transient ischemic attack.
3.  Pulmonary embolism.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Negative exercise Thallium test in [**2175-2-26**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.

5.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking three months ago
following three to four packs per day times forty years.  He
consumed two to three drinks per day.  He is a construction
worker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 99, heart
rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%.
In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils
2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube
is in place.  Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination - The patient had
diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds
on the right.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normal bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with 1+
distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies at the outside
hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of
11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.  The differential
on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes,
and 8% monocytes.  Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium
5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.  Prothrombin time was 22.4,
partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0.  Arterial blood
gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a
100% FIO2.  Urinalysis was within normal limits.  CKs were 41
and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.

Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no
infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction
with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.  A Transesophageal
echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and
apical hypokinesis.  The patient was also noted to develop
new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated
hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but
remained hypotensive requiring pressors.  A CT angiogram was
performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

On [**2175-9-19**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated
decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.  The
patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101
while urine culture grew E. coli.  The patient was started on
intravenous Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Tobramycin and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
received intravenous fluids and was changed from Levophed to
vasopressin with good effect.  On [**2175-9-21**], the pressors were
weaned.

Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture
sites with some thick secretions.  On [**2175-9-22**], the patient
was successfully extubated.  Over the weekend of [**2175-9-23**],
and [**2175-9-24**], the patient defervesced with decreasing white
blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications
with stable blood pressure.  His antibiotics other than
Levaquin were discontinued.  The patient was then transferred
to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery
disease.

Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary
artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex arteries with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient was
titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor.  Lipid panel
indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137,
LDL of 133 and HDL of 41.  He was therefore started on statin
therapy for hypercholesterolemia.

The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the
30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found
to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228,
transferrin of 175. These findings were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung
cancer.

On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have
bilateral carotid bruits.  Carotid Doppler studies were
performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis
and mild plaquing bilaterally.

The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital
course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated
discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the
patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with
regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with
a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q.d.  Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic
control during hospital course.

A physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time
of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient
would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient
physical therapy follow-up.

At the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be
discharged to home with VNA.  He was also to follow-up in [**Hospital 191**]
Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and
was to follow-up with his primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] firm.
He was to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin, which
had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge
in order to treat his urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac
catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery
stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex.
3.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion to normal
sinus rhythm.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISPOSITION:  On discharge, it is anticipated at the time of
dictation that the patient will be discharged to home with
VNA and will require outpatient physical therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a total course of fourteen
days.
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.
9.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
10. Oxygen four liters nasal cannula.
11. Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. until INR is greater
than 2.0.
12. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments q4hours
p.r.n.
13. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Much improved.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer
treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with
saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart
failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently
admitted from [**7-15**] to [**2176-7-19**] for presumed
bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough,
shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admission
two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day
Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwent
bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial
lesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at that
time showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baseline
function on [**2176-7-19**].  The plan was to treat him for one
week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one
week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for
pneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was
[**2176-7-22**] after being on Augmentin for only three days.

He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he
developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was
due to low potassium.  Within the following days he
complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum.  He
had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening
cough and presented to the Emergency Department.  He denied
any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.  In the Emergency Department
he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and
a blood pressure of 118/56.  Respiratory rate 28.  Sating 88
to 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  Initially he was stable, but
then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia,
which resulted in his elective intubation.  He received Lasix
100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of Bumex and 1 gram of
Ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  He was also
placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic INR and given
morphine and Ativan for sedation.  Chest x-ray showed no
focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.  The patient
then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage three squamous cell lung

b.i.d., Flovent 110 micrograms four puffs twice a day.
Combivent inhaler two puffs four times a day.  Duo-neb
solution four times a day as needed.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.,
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg a day, Glyburide 5 mg once a
day, Colace 100 mg twice a day, Senna prn, Coumadin 5 mg once
a day except for 4 mg on Tuesday and Thursday, Neurontin 300
mg b.i.d., Oxycontin 20 mg t.i.d., Paxil 20 mg q.d., Lipitor
10 mg q.d., Ambien 15 mg q.h.s. and a regular insulin sliding
scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking in [**2175-5-28**]
following a forty year history of smoking three to four packs
a day.  He consumed two to three drinks alcoholic drinks per
day and was a construction worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This was a gentleman who was
intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli.
Pupils were unremarkable.  There were no bruits in the neck.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2
sounds, faint heart sounds overall.  Occasional ectopic
beats. Lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with
transmitted breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft and
mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities
showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower
extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing.  Skin showed no
evidence of rashes.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Urinalysis was unremarkable.  White
blood cell count 23, hematocrit 42, platelets were 297.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the hospital the patient
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis
versus atypical pneumonia.  Blood sputum, urine and stool
cultures were sent and Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were
started.

1.  Infectious disease:  The patient did not develop a focal
infiltration throughout his hospitalization.  His Ceftriaxone
was stopped and he was continued on Azithromycin.  He
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay
and his white blood cell count decreased daily.  On hospital
day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation
very well.  He was then transferred on hospital day number
three out of the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor.
He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his
fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.  He also
subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was
comfortable and ambulating without oxygen.  He stated that he
had come back to his baseline.  White blood cell count
returned to [**Location 213**] range, and cultures were negative except
for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive
coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.

2.  Pulmonary:  This was treated as possible
tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease versus atypical pneumonia.  The patient was kept on
his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as
Azithromycin and intravenous Solu-Medrol.  After hospital day
number two and the patient was extubated and improving the
Solu-Medrol was switched to Prednisone and was rapidly
tapered.  The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was
given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical
therapy.  By the end of the hospitalization the patient felt
that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline
pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum.  To
manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used
judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of
the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily
weights.  The patient responded to this well and felt overall
that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not
clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his
change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.  Three
sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.  He had a number of electrocardiograms
that were checked to ensure that he did not have a
significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not
worse.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose
measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor
control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding
scale.  As the regular insulin sliding scale was increased
and the Prednisone was tapered these values returned closer
to normal.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Humibid LA 600 mg b.i.d.  2.
Lasix 160 mg b.i.d.  3.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents po

The patient had been using Care Group Respiratory Services at
home for pulmonary physical therapy and O2 assistance and so
this was arranged on an outpatient basis, with chest physical
therapy and incentive spirometry and other pulmonary
treatments.  The plan was that he would follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic the following week and that he would have
an INR drawn on [**8-6**] calling the results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer
status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], six
hospitalizations since [**2176-5-27**], last discharged on
[**2176-8-4**], with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis
versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus
atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the MICU,
chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on
alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since [**2175-9-28**] for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post
myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness
of breath beginning on the day of admission.

The patient reported a [**1-29**] day history of general fatigue.
On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a
systolic blood pressure of 70.  The wife drove the patient to
the Emergency Room.  The patient also complained of some
dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever,
chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  He reported good p.o. intake
and appetite.

The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough,
however, denied any sputum production.  He took his oral
temperature at home and denied any fever.  At home, the
patient is on oxygen of [**12-31**] L via nasal cannula.  The patient
recently finished a steroid taper on [**8-14**] which was
two weeks in length.  He reported a usual SBP of 80-110.  The
patient did note that since [**Month (only) 216**], a Scopolamine patch was
added to his regimen and has increased his secretions
significantly.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient
appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed
on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2
of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was a
venous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs,
Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to
the patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly after
arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to
baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via
nasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at
18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained of
shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly
tired.  Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute
PE.  The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the
Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage III squamous cell lung
cancer diagnosis in [**2175-2-26**], status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], with radiation, Carboplatin,
and Taxol treatments.  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease with PFTs in [**2176-5-27**] showing an FEV1 of 0.83 L,
which is 25% of predicted, and FEV1 to FVC ration of 68% of
predicted.  3.  Congestive heart failure with preserved left
ventricular function in [**2176-5-27**].  4.  Atrial fibrillation.

mg q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife and quit smoking
in [**2175-5-28**].  He smoked 3-4 packs per day for 40 years.  No
alcohol abuse.  He is a retired construction worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at age 39 of cancer.  Brother is
status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  Father with
history of coronary artery disease.  Sister with heart valve
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.5??????, heart
rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.  He was
comfortable.  He was alert and awake.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Distant heart sounds.
Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Loud rhonchi
throughout the left lung field.  No apparent wheezing or
rubs.  Transmitted sounds to right side.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is
baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT
22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7.

Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.  Theophylline level
4.3.

Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung
with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no
pneumothorax, no effusion.  CT angiogram showed no acute PE,
possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left
lower lobe that is not occlusive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past
medical history of lung carcinoma status post right
pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 205**]
for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating
antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent
hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions,
and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure,
prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with
respiratory distress.

1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was given Lasix,
Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department
and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.  It was thought
that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely
secondary to mucous plugging.  PE was ruled out by CTA.
Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.  The patient also recently completed a steroid
taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this
admission.  He had no cough and no sputum production and no
fevers.  The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as
it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress
and because it was unclear whether steroids was really
benefitting this patient.

He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for
secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine
patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and
inhalers.  He was also continued on his alternating
prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim.  He
continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of
greater than 92%.  On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation
was 97% on room air.

Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but
was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes
of respiratory distress.

2.  Hypotension:  The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood
pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the
Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90.  It was thought that the
patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to
hypovolemia.  He was given gentle fluid hydration.  He also
had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal
insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid
taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been
given to the patient.  It was reportedly negative, but it was
unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent
Solu-Medrol dosing.  His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg
b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was
discontinued.  He continued to remain normovolemic during the
rest of his hospitalization.

3.  Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of
perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and
congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his
Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.   He also continued Aspirin
and Lipitor.  His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was
thought that there was not any significant cardiac component
to the patient's respiratory distress.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his Glyburide
and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the
hospital.

5.  History of pulmonary embolus:  The patient was continued
on his Coumadin while in-house.  No further work-up was done.

6.  CODE STATUS:  THE PATIENT IS FULL CODE.

DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to pulmonary
rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status.  He
appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during
this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise
tolerance.  He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10
mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to
relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Mucous plugging.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Diabetes type 2.
6.  History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged to
pulmonary rehabilitation.

FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] and his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**], complicated by pulmonary artery
laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for
oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health
until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower
abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
He presented to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room on [**2177-11-25**].  At that time he denied
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and
bright red blood per rectum.  He had dark stools at baseline
secondary to iron use.  The stool was found to be guaiac
positive in the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency
Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a
baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic
with an INR of 9.8.  Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in
the Emergency Department were unsuccessful.  While in the
Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of
subcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to the
Medicine Floor.  Repeat hematocrit several hours later
dropped to a value of 13.  The nasogastric tube was placed on
the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh
blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7
cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately
25 cm.  There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding.
He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red
blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit
of platelets.  He also received intravenous fluid
resuscitation with normal saline.  Computerized tomography
scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for
diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed
some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
descending colon.  Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no
stigmata of recent bleeding.  The patient's coagulopathy was
improving.  His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred
to the General Medicine Floor on [**2177-11-28**].  Of note,
prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper
extremity and complained of pain of the right upper
extremity.  Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed
evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.

showed PT 38.5, PTT 38.0, INR 9.8.  Serum chemistries showed
sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 30, BUN
52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 196.  Liver function tests showed
ALT 18, AST 26, amylase 23, lipase 24, albumin 3.4, alkaline
phosphatase 100.  Cardiac enzymes showed creatinine kinase
82, troponin I 0.04.  Chest x-ray was negative for any acute
pulmonary process.  Abdominal x-ray demonstrated
opacification of the right lung base.  The left lung base was
clear.  There was no free air in the abdomen.  There was a
large amount of fecal material in the right colon.  There was
a normal bowel gas pattern.  There was no evidence of
obstruction.  Later computerized tomography scan of the
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess,
bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer,
appendicitis or diverticulitis.  Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis,
prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T
wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new.
No acute ST elevations or depressions noted.  This was
compared with the prior electrocardiogram from [**2177-10-9**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with
past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in
[**2175-1-26**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration,
status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and
suctioning.  He was in his usual state of health until
[**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal
pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.  His
hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.  His
gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's
gastrointestinal workup included two
esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one
without source of frank bleed.  However, in light of his
initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac
positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected.
Physically the small bowel could be the source.  After
stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood
products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was
transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable
hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.  While on the floor,
his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.  After
demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced
out to q. day hematocrit checks.  All told the patient
received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh
frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital
stay.  On [**2177-12-3**], the patient underwent repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples
of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.  At
the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were
pending.  While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether
hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.  He had a
normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and
bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very
unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his
hospital course and were consistent with changes status post
large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing
hemolysis.

2.  Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2177-11-28**] the patient began to complain of right upper
extremity pain and swelling.  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated
an axillary deep vein thrombosis.  In light of his recent
bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize
as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was
still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of
the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the
functionality of his one remaining lung.  The computerized
tomography scan was performed to better examine the right
upper extremity soft tissues.  In particular there was
concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass
lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be
contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep
vein thrombosis formation.  Computerized tomographic venogram
was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis,
however.  The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced
by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in
the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there
was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.  Therefore,
an inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2177-12-2**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  On [**2177-12-4**], the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling
of the right lower extremity.  Examination was consistent
with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava
filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the
decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging
of the right lower extremity.  In light of his probable
hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate
anticoagulation with the Coumadin.  His Coumadin level will
be followed by his outpatient physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation
facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a
goal INR of 2 to 3.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma
status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued
on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary
toilet.  He was continued on his outpatient medicines,
Combivent, Salmeterol, and Theophylline.  He was continued on
antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light
of his history of bronchiectasis.  He was monitored for acute
decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly
concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper
extremity deep vein thrombosis.  He continued to improve from
a respiratory standpoint.  He was diuresed gently after
arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid
resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.  With
the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his
respiratory status improved somewhat.  However, he is not
back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at
home.  At the time of discharge he was maintaining
saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he
continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and
shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.  It was felt that
a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle
deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital
stay.  Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary
rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his
conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.

4.  Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a
diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood
glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin
for neuropathy.

5.  Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient
dose of Amiodarone.  Of note, he is currently in sinus
rhythm.

6.  Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an
elevated creatinine level above his baseline.  This was
likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia
and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his
acute bleeding episode.  His acute renal failure resolved
after fluid hydration.

7.  Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000
mcg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.

10.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed
a diabetic heart-healthy diet.  He received supplementation
with multivitamins and Vitamin B12.  Electrolytes were
aggressively repleted.  At the time of discharge he was
tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other
incident.

DISPOSITION:  With the patient's general deconditioning as
well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his
baseline I felt that he would benefit from an inpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation program.  He will be discharged to
such a program.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable.  Afebrile.
Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula,
ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 243**] intake without

history of multiple medical problems who was recently
admitted to the [**Hospital6 256**] from
[**2178-11-26**] to [**2177-12-5**] with projectile vomiting and
hematocrit of 13.

He had negative hemolysis workup and negative EGD times two
and a colonoscopy times one.  Found to have a right upper and

chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, glucose
149, CK 96, troponin 0.06.

EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline;
no other ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple
medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia
and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple
polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on
[**2178-1-15**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most
likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and
polypectomy.  Patient had a negative EGD and then had a
colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of
previous polypectomy.  This was clipped with two clips with
good control of the bleeding.

Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  He did receive a total
of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission.
After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright
red blood per rectum was noted.  Patient's hematocrits were
followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and
eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to
discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of
discharge.

Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced
his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he
tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright
red blood per rectum.

Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously
b.i.d. as his EGD was negative.  Eventually was switched back
to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an
outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused
with blood.  He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and
negative EGD.  Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small
bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as
in his previous admission.  This was also negative.  Patient
could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of
barium and can have it at least one week after barium
ingestion.

Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's
Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held.
Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and
Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be
restarted on [**2178-1-27**] per GI.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's
respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  Continued his
home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and
p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam
remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2
liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.

3.  Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  Was
stable with tracheostomy.  Continued b.i.d. suctioning with
good results.  Continue the Scopolamine patch for
antiemetics.

4.  Prostate cancer:  He does have recently rising PSA most
recently 8.9 in 02/[**2177**].  Patient was eventually able to have
a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative
for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony
changes.  Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 261**], in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.

5.  Troponin leak:  This was attributed to demand ischemia.
He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in
[**1-/2175**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting
disease.  His enzymes remained stable through the course of
his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  Patient's aspirin
was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted
[**2178-1-27**].  Patient was continued on his statin.

6.  Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was in sinus rhythm
throughout the course of his stay and was stable on
Amiodarone.  Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with
bleeding.

7.  Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  He has a
history of [**Location (un) 260**] filter and right upper and right lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis.  His hypercoagulable state
is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise
his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient
did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper
and right lower extremity.

Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of
the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.  Was
given p.r.n. doses of Lasix throughout the stay and continued
to elevate his extremities with good results of them.

Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds
done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.  The right lower
extremity ultrasound was negative.  The right upper extremity
did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but
no progression or change from previous studies, and this
otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.

8.  Diabetes:  He has fairly good control with hemoglobin A1C
most recently at 6.0.  He was continued on his home regimen
of Glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding
scale as needed.

For his neuropathy patient was continued on his Tylenol
Number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for Morphine
sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on
this during the course of his stay.

9.  Gout:  This was stable throughout the course of his
admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of
Colchicine.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) Respiratory distress: Improved with face mask. Serial ABGs
showed hypercarbic failure, improved with face mask. Switched to
nasal cannula in PM [**11-18**], but ABGs with ongoing hypercarbia in
the 80s. At night, patient had sub-acute worsening respiratory
status, with desaturation and tachypnea, along with agitation
and confusion. pH with PCO2 in 90s. Placed on CPAP,
unsuccessfully. Repeat ABG with PaCO2 87, pH 7.29. Patient
intubated. Arterial line finally placed successfully. Extubated
on [**11-19**] but extremely anxious and hypertensive and hypercarbic.
Placed on BIPAP and reintubated. [**2178-11-23**] trach placed.  Pt was
stable with the trach and venitilator support.  Pt has been
maintaining stable oxygenation and ventilation on pressure
controlled ventilation with PS 3, PEEP 5, Fi02 0.5, PIP 22, TV
500-600, RR18.
He benefited from albuterol/atrovent nebs, suction, steroids. At
the time of discharge he was on day 4 of prednisone taper.  Pt
was also on Zosyn for GNR, has h/o pseudomonas. No further abx
at the time of discharge.

2) [**Name (NI) 283**] Pt was placed on amiodarone for afib, but this was
discontinued when he developed persistent bradycardia to the
30's-40's on [**2177-11-29**]. Pt was also anticoagulated on a heparin
drip and on [**11-24**] began coumadin loading.

3)bradycardia- likely [**12-30**] amiodarone; resolved after holding
this med ([**2178-11-30**]). pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] and will
likely need a Holter Monitor as an outpt. TFT's pending at time
of discharge.

4) agitation: likely due to hypercarbic reso drive, controlled
with haldol and then resolved completely when respiratory status
stabilized.

5) DM: controlled on RISS with standing dose of NPH.

6) FEN: [**Last Name (STitle) 282**] tube placed on [**2177-11-29**] without complication.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right
pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Year/Month/Day 282**] placement and
antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from [**Hospital **] rehab
with diarrhea, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. No
source of infection had been identified so far. He was C-diff
negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism.
He was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and
metronidazole for 7 days. His blood pressure responded to fluid
challenge and he has been normotensive since then. He was
started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. He was
gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.

His blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding
scale. He was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. Plastic
surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not
necessary. Therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing,
Kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. He remiained in
normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial
fibrillation.

He was very agitated in the ICU. He was weaned off fentanyl drip
and put on fentanyl patch. He also was put on standing zyprexa
and prn haldol, morphine. He was also on standing valium and was
actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims
that he was on valium at home.He is full code and his health
care proxy is his wife.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD
here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain.
.
1. Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and
CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then
remained stable at 0.12.  Repeat EKGs showed no changes.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence
of an acute ischemic event.  Pt was continued on ASA.  The pt's
chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean
secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of
recurrent pneumonias.  Pt was continued on AC at night and
pressure support during the day.  He will continued to wean at
rehab.
.
3. Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic
since last admission w/o evidence of DVT.  Pt had another CTA in
the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC.
Interventional radiology placed a stent in the SVC and over the
next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for
most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib
with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.  Pt was
continued on his coumadin.
.
5. Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on
fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. AVOID benzos as pt has
paradoxical response.
*
6. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around
28.  Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal
TIBC, ferritin.  He was transfused once to [**Last Name (un) 291**] hct>30.
.
7. DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an
insulin sliding scale.
.
8. Access: A PICC line was placed by IR when pt was having his
SVC stented.  If this line is not needed, it should be pulled to
decrease infection risk.  It was placed on [**2179-2-4**].

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo man with many medical problems p/w hypotension in the
setting of rapid aitral flutter. Also with a Urinary Tract
Infection.

Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p
right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Month/Day/Year 282**] [**Hospital **]
rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI.
.
1. Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs.
symptomatic tachycardia.
Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control.
Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note,
his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported
that this is a [**Last Name 294**] problem for him.
.
2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial
Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1
conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital
day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with
Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem
was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the
past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia
when lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone
400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week then 200mg po QD
thereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers.

3. Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of
Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by
respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained
due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff
leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to
change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the
future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to
ventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of
rest on Assist Control.
.
4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started
on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given
history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to
complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture
grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter
was discontinued.
.
5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He
was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3,
his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from
site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an
appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have [**Known lastname **]
guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive
bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his
trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient,
and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for
trace blood.
.
6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin
for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic.
After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading
to anemia with hct 19.   He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg
iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on
coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular
insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control.
.
6. Pain/anxiety/depression:
He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl
75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg
tid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus
ulcer.
.
7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and
continued on DSD for sacral wound.
.
8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed...
.
9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to
keep fluid even.
.
10.Code: FULL
.
11. Dispo: Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
.
12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen
catheter was not discontinued per [**Hospital1 296**] request. This was
placed on [**2179-3-21**].
------
Outstanding issues on discharge:
1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of
discharge [**3-26**].  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose
accordingly.
2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to
r/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call [**Hospital1 18**] to
follow this up. Regardless, he is being restarted on
anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.

History of Present Illness:
65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including
history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**], severe
COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure
due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now
presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from
records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission
at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his
admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to
the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic
and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to
60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received
a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained
unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an
FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple
lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**].
.
Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide
additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well
until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able
to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on
Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was
maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend.
Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked ""very scared""
and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his
eyes ""rolling back in his head"". He was occasionally responsive
to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the
last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed
the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was
slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very
diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she
reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to
a skin tear on the right.
.
In the ED, the pt's VS were, 99.8 85 80/60-L 150/80-R 20 100% AC
400/20/100%/PEEP 5. He received vancomyicin and zosyn. Pt was
initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after
learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally
low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been
stable in the 120s off of pressors. No new consolidation on CXR.
Normal lactate.

studies:
ECG- Sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute. Nonspecific ST-T wave
changes but no major changes since previous studies.
.
CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right
lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal
contours toward the right consistent with previous
pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural
effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left
lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal
consolidation.
.
Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or
evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.

US upper extremity:IMPRESSION:
1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein.
2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The
gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located
at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is
thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps
located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common
duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein
is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no
focal abnormality.

IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the
gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper
clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with
cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute
cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced
by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical
concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of
IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2176-9-11**] and [**2179-3-21**].

FINDINGS:
Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right
pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is
no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with
a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the
right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary
calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery
appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.

Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen
scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of
cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is
also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation
or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left
lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is
again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the
surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on
the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears
stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. The bronchi appear patent to the
segmental level within the left lung.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material
within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating
to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the
stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper
abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The
soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen
throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the
entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration
pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the
CT appearance.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**]
demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder.
5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type
2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from
[**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension.

#ID/sepsis
Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating
blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was
measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His
blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors
were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas),
blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on
discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited
line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with
aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days.
He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the
rest of his hospital stay.

#Mental status changes:
His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with
narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was
at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken
into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes.
Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED.

#anemia/coagulation
Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter
and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on
coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital
admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley.
In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right
subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery
was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood.
The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no
hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which
revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin
drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from
arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was
given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable
since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should
be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable.
.
#transaminitis
He presented intially with transaminitis likely from
hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was
done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension,
thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal
tenderness

#respiratory:
Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and
post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern
about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to
prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a
foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak
is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on
assist control ventilation.
.
# [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most
likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his
needs. He recieved free water through G tube.
.
# Cardiac
Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such
complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and
calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia.
.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale
while in hospital.

#Anxiety/pain
Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at
baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for
anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is
from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been
severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further
ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a
concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine.
THis should be adjusted in [**Hospital1 **].

# Sacral Decubitus:
He had Kinair bed

# FEN
Tube feeds was continued with no residual

#access
He had picc line on discharge

#code
OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family
meeting)

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cough/shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] is a 60-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for hypertension,
times two, who developed a dry cough in late [**Month (only) **] while
fly fishing in [**State 1727**].  The cough persisted and he was given
erythromycin times ten days times two courses by his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1728**].  The erythromycin did not improve
the patient's symptoms.

The patient describes the cough as dry, not worse at night,
breath.  He denied fevers and  chills.  He states that he
lost about six pounds over the past two months intentionally.
Over the past one to two weeks, however, he has noted
increasing dyspnea with stairs, as well as fatigue.  On the
day prior to admission, he started a Z pack.

At his primary care physician's office today, he had a chest
x-ray which disclosed an enlarged heart and interstitial
infiltrates.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, as well
as an echocardiogram which disclosed evidence of a
pericardial effusion with tamponade.

There was diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right
ventricle.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department
at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of the
pericardial effusion and drainage.  His pulses paradoxes was
18.  The echocardiogram performed in the Emergency Department
was consistent with cardiac tamponade.  The patient remained

Elderly white male in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric, oropharynx clear, pupils
equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements
intact.  Neck:  Supple, no carotid bruit, no jugular venous
distention.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, soft
S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, pericardial drain in

Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
Alert and oriented times three.  Exam otherwise nonfocal.
Note:  This physical examination was done after the patient
underwent his cardiac catheterization.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.3,
hematocrit of 41, platelet count of 294,000.  PT 13, PTT
23.6, INR 1.1.  Echocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm, 71
beats per minute, electrical alternans, low voltage
precordial leads, prolonged PR.  After the procedure,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a sinus rhythm at 82 beats
per minute, normal axis, prolonged PR, T wave inversions I
and aVL, biphasic T in V2, Qs in V1 to V2, increased voltage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted initially to the
Coronary Care Unit.  He underwent a cardiac catheterization
on [**11-16**] for pericardiocentesis.  Hemodynamics showed
elevated and equal RA and pericardial pressures, 11-12 mm
mercury, slightly lower than pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure.  There was preserved cardiac index.  There is
preserved blood pressure with 15-20 mm mercury pulses
paradoxes.  During the pericardiocentesis, 1116 ml of
serosanguinous fluid was easily removed. Fluid was sent to
the laboratory for analysis.

Following the pericardiocentesis, the patient was admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit for further management.  On [**11-17**], the pericardial drain was removed.  Repeat echocardiogram
did not disclose recurrence of the pericardial effusion.
Patient underwent CT of the chest which disclosed diffuse
interstitial infiltrates consistent with lymphangitic spread.
There was also a positive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and
lytic sclerotic bone lesions.

On [**11-19**], the patient was transferred to the [**Location (un) **]
Service.  On the night of the 16th, he was tachycardic to the
160s.  Echocardiogram disclosed atrial flutter.  His blood
pressure was stable.  He was started on sotalol 120 mg b.i.d.
The following day this was decreased to 80 mg b.i.d.  While
on sotalol, his QTC interval was monitored and his potassium
was kept between 4.5 and 5.2.  Repeat echocardiogram did not
disclose re-accumulation of the pericardial effusion.

While on the [**Location (un) **] Service.  A Pulmonary Consult was
obtained for further evaluation of the diffuse infiltrates
seen on the CT.  Pulmonary Service recommended awaiting the
final pathology from the pericardial fluid.  They were
willing to perform transbronchial biopsy if necessary.

Patient was also seen by his Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**].  Patient
underwent an MRI of his brain on [**11-23**].  MRI disclosed
foci on the surface of the brain that appeared consistent
with leptomeningeal spread of cancer.  An abdominal CT was
done on [**11-23**].  CT of the abdomen disclosed one
lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease throughout the
lungs was stable since the study one week before.  There was
an increase in the pericardial fluid since the study one week
prior.  There was interval development of multiple sclerotic
and lytic lesions within the osseous structures since [**2139**].
There were stable hepatic lesions that likely represent
simple cysts. There was a stable splenic lesion that likely
represents a hemangioma.  Although, colon appeared grossly
normal, radiologist's caution that the study was not
diagnostic for colon cancer.

Finally, pathology results from pericardial fluid were
obtained.  Pathologists performed multiple stains to identify
the type of cancer, the types of cells in the pericardial
fluid.  Pathologist's concluded that the malignant cells were
from adenocarcinoma.  The tumor cells are positive for CK7
and TTF1 markers.  TTF1 marker is specific for lung and
thyroid.  The cells were focally positive for CK20.
Pathologist's concluded that this immunoprofile is consistent
with an adenocarcinoma arising in the lung.

The patient was discharged on [**11-24**].  He will have
outpatient work-up of his malignancy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient discharged home on Monday,
[**2140-11-28**].

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with his Oncologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**], at 2 p.m.  He will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in the
Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic at 4 p.m. on [**2140-11-28**].  He will
follow-up with his Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on Wednesday,
[**2140-11-30**].  He was encouraged to call his primary
care physician for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**] appointment.  Patient was
given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Heart's monitor so that his QTC interval
could be monitored for an additional week while on sotalol.

He has noted one week prior to admission progressive increase
He had a pulses paradoxus of 15 in the emergency department.
No fever, chills, chest pain, cough, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain.  He had a normal p.o. intake but
decreased ambulation secondary to weakness post XRT.  Can go
approximately 10 steps and then gets tired with short of
breath.

In the emergency department he got a dose of Levofloxacin for
concern of pneumonia and bronchitis and stress dose steroids.

Chest x-ray shows increased in cardiac silhouette.
Electrocardiogram showed alternans.  Bedside echo concerning
for tamponade.  Catheterization laboratory for pericardial
drain placement.  Got 2500 cc's removed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, mitral valve prolapse, status post
melanoma.  Status post resection in [**2118**] and [**2138**].  Empyema
left lung [**2122**], status post thoracotomy and supraventricular
tachycardia.  Lung adenocarcinoma with metastases to brain,
[**Year (4 digits) 500**], pericardium.  Now undergoing brain XRT.  Atrial
flutter, peripheral visual loss.

An echo on [**11/2134**] showed EF greater than 55%

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

3.  Sotalol 80 mg twice a day.
4.  Ambien 10 mg q h.s.
5.  Lipitor 80 mg q h.s.
6.  Folate 1 mg q day.
7.  Accupril 10 mg q day.
8.  ASA 81 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with a daughter at home.  No tobacco
in the past 20 years, no alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission in general no acute
distress, pleasant, slightly tachypneic.  Vital signs 97.5,
heart rate 94, blood pressure 99/61.  Respiratory rate 36,
99% on 100% face mask.  Left pupil minimally reactive, down
visual acuity.  OP clear.  Neck: No jugular venous
distention.  Pulmonary:  Coronary artery disease bilaterally.
Carotids:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, no distension.  Bowel sounds positive.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  2+ distal
pulses bilaterally.  Neurological 5/5 strength bilaterally.
Pupils reactive.

Electrocardiogram on admission normal sinus rhythm,
electrical alternans.  Normal intervals, no ST changes or
Q-waves, diffuse T-wave changes.

LABS:  White blood count 9.6, hematocrit 36.1, platelets 128.
INR 1.3.  NA 137, K 4.6.  CL 104, CO2 20.  BUN 31, creatinine
0.8.  Glucose 140.

Chest x-ray shows increased in cardiac size, increased
pericardial effusion.  Increased left pleural effusion.
Lymphangitic tumor spread unchanged.  A left TTX new since
[**2140-11-19**].

The patient was taken from the Emergency Room to the CCU for
close monitoring.  Given large pericardial effusion and
tamponade physiology.  On cardiac catheterization he
demonstrated low pressure tamponade with equalization of
right atrium and pericardial pressures.  After removal of
approximately one liter of bloody fluid his right atrial and
pericardial pressure decreased.  Procedure was notable for
pericardial preparation and partial pneumothorax given low
atrial/pericardial pressures and evidence of a possible small
left pneumothorax.  For this reason the drain was pulled.
However, subsequent review of the chest x-ray showed that the
finding of pneumothorax was present prior to the procedure.
Follow-up echocardiogram revealed resolution of electrical
alternans.  CT Surgery was consulted for possibility of
placing a pericardial window for definitive treatment of
recurrent pericardial effusions however, it was felt that a
procedure of this degree of invasiveness would likely lead to
patient's deterioration rather than improvement.

The decision was made that the patient would be best served
by a balloon pericardiocentesis via catheter done by
Cardiology however, this would require waiting until the
pericardial effusion re-accumulated.  Recommended that the
patient undergo q week transthoracic echocardiogram in order
to assess the size of pericardial effusion and when deemed
large enough the patient is to undergo balloon
pericardiocentesis.

The patient's cardiac status improved with this procedure
however, his respiratory status remained tenuous requiring
100% non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturations in the
mid-90%  The patient had marked dyspnea on exertion
throughout hospitalization.  It was felt that this is a
combination of intrinsic lung damage as well as lymphangitic
spread and some small degree of residual cardiac dysfunction.
Other than oxygen and nebulizers there is no further
therapeutic option for this patient at this time.  The
patient remained on Sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. as he was as an
outpatient for an supraventricular tachycardia and remained
in a normal sinus rhythm throughout hospitalization.

Hem/Onc.  The patient continued XRT as well as Decadron for
palliation.  He will be followed by Hem/Onc as an outpatient.
There were no gastrointestinal issues throughout this
hospitalization.

Infectious Disease.  The patient was not felt to be infected
and after the initial dose of Levofloxacin in the emergency
department antibiotics were discontinued.  The patient
remained afebrile.

Dictation will be completed with discharge diagnosis and
discharge medications prior to discharge.

Onc History:
subcarinal LAD noted on bronchscopy in [**1-23**] which was negative
for malignant cells. Referred by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] to heme onc for
enlarged lower lobe lung mass. Mediastinoscopy was performed in
[**11-22**] which was suggestive of atypical chronic lymphocytic
leukemia.  Lung biopsy performed revealed a large Bcell NHL. The
probable basis for his problem is understood to be
transformation of CLL to a [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] syndrome. s/p 3 cycles of
CHOP
.
Lymph Node bx [**11-22**]:
Immunophenotypic findings are of involvement by a

CXR:
AP AND LATERAL CHEST: The heart size is normal. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous without focal dilatation. There has been
interval worsening of right upper lobe, left upper lobe, and
left retrocardiac airspace opacities consistent with multifocal
pneumonia. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is a
likely small left pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Worsening of the multifocal pneumonia.
.
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in patchy ground glass opacities
bilaterally, predominantly in the upper lungs, consistent with
worsening multifocal pneumonia.
2. Unchanged appearance of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right
middle and lower lungs, consistent with infection.
3. Unchanged appearance of left lower lung mass.

[**5-9**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-6**] and 21. Severe
consolidation in the left lung and in the right lung apex more
significantly since [**5-8**]. Pleural effusion, moderate on the
left and small on the right is stable. Heart size top normal.
Findings could represent worsening of either asymmetric
pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: Briefly pt is a 79 M with [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] syndrome
(transformation of CLL to large B cell NHL) s/p 3 cycles of CHOP
who originally presented here for multifocal PN on [**4-18**] and
started on levofloxacin. On the evening of [**4-19**] pt with irreg
tachy - ? MAT. Pt then became hypoxic on NRB and CXR w/
worsening multifocal infiltrates. CTA r/o'd PE. Treated w/
Vanc/Zosyn. Pt temporarily on heparin gtt and had 9pt HCT drop.
He was tx'd 2 units pRBC, remained in resp distress, developed
RVR, flash pulm edema, and was intubated. His Tpn peaked at
0.44. TTE revealed EF 25%. Bronchoscopy on [**4-21**] neg. Pt was
started on metoprolol/captopril and extubated.
.
He was tx'd to OMED svc. Again decompensated with RVR and
required NRB by [**4-29**]. He also developed diarrhea, a rising WBC,
and a lactate up to 5.7. He was tx'd back to the ICU for hypoxic
respiratory failure and intubated. He was treated with flagyl
for c dif despite negative toxins, levoflox for atypical
coverage, [**Last Name (un) 2830**] and vanco to complete a course of antibiotics. He
was noted to have an NSTEMI on [**4-29**] with peak MB 64 and Trop
1.08. His volume status was managed, he was aggressively
suctioned and extubated with a plan for no reintubation after
extensive discussion with the family and pt's son and HCP(ie:
DNR/DNI).
.
He returned to the OMED service on [**2191-5-7**] where there was
apparently another conversation regarding code status during
which the pt requested to be Full Code, though his family felt
that he was confused and did not understand the meaning of the
conversation. His son [**Name (NI) 382**] and daughter continued to request
that he be DNR/DNI and felt that this was in keeping with his
desires. On the BMT unit, the patient was initiated on TPN. He
was also noted to have another increase in CE's [**5-8**] with a MB
30 and Trop 1.[**Street Address(2) 6262**] elevations on EKG. He received lasix
20mg x 3 over the day of [**5-8**] to maintain negative fluid
balance. He became tachypneic and desaturated to an O2 sat of
79% on RA. His HR was 106. He was started on NRB and ABG showed
7.36/33/63 and his sats on NRB ranged from 90-94%. He was also
given 40 mg IV lasix and pt had 60 cc foley output. CXR
confirmed worsening CHF.
.
ICU was called for transfer given his tachypnea, hypoxia, and
increased work of breathing. The patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**], who
was involved in the code discussions (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] was [**First Name (STitle) 653**]
and felt the pt should remain DNR/DNI. The pt's son was also
[**Name (NI) 653**] and felt very strongly that the patient should be
DNR/DNI. [**Name (NI) **] sister was also called because she was
present during the daytime today when code status was changed
and confirmed that the patient was confused today, answered only
""yes"" to questions, and did not clearly state his desires when
asked. Prior to transfer to ICU, the patient was confused and in
respiratory distress and did not reliably answer questions. He
was transfered to the ICU for further monitoring.
.
In the ICU, the pt's code status remained DNR/DNI.  Family and
PCP were [**Name (NI) 653**].  The pt continued to deteriorate and goals
of care were turned to comfort primarily.  He died comfortably.

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Left non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 6/[**2182**].


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2183-7-23**]: bronchoscopy and mediastonoscopy
[**2183-7-25**]: LUL segmentectomy, LLL wedge resection


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2970**] is a 77-year-old gentleman, referred by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for advice and options regarding a
carcinoma of the lung detected during recent hospitalization for
coronary disease and a large aortic aneurysm in [**2183-5-8**]. A
lesion in the left lung was discovered in the upper lobe and a
needle biopsy confirmed non-small cell carcinoma.  He underwent
a PET scan, which showed extreme hypermetabolism with an SUV of
17 at the site of the lung primary lesion.  There is sparse
uptake within the mediastinum, not considered of pathologic
significance, as well as active inflammation around the
abdominal graft.

He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2183-7-23**] for an operation to address his
left non-small cell lung cancer.


Past Medical History:
Significant for coronary disease, status
post an infarction.  He has aortic aneurysm, increased serum
cholesterol, prostate cancer, and carcinoma of the sigmoid
colon.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Sigmoid colectomy in [**2171**], radical
prostatectomy in [**2169**], and the tube graft repair of his
abdominal
aortic aneurysm.


Social History:
He has substantial prior smoking history, just recently quit.
He has no active alcohol issues.


Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight of 148 pounds.  He is afebrile, blood
pressure 140/83, pulse 74 and regular, and room air saturation
is
95%.
LUNGS:  His lung fields are surprisingly clear.
HEART:  Regular rhythm and rate without murmur or gallop.
NECK:  There were no carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good healing ridge along the
wound.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no peripheral edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of planned surgery.
He was noted to have significant bradycardia prior to starting
the operation.  He did undergo a flexible bronchoscopy and
mediastinoscopy that was complicated by substantial
intraoperative bleeding.  He was subsequently ruled out for a
cardiac event, and remained
hemodynamically and neurologically stable on POD#1. On HD#3, the
decision was made to proceed with a segmental resection given
the T2 size of the lesion and his limited baseline lung
function. Please refer to both operative notes of [**2183-7-23**] and
[**2183-7-25**] for further details of the procedures. An epidural was
placed for postoperative pain control on [**2183-7-25**]. Two left-sided
chest tubes were placed intraoperatively, and a post-operative
chest radiograph showed a moderate left sided pneumothorax.

On [**2183-7-25**], he was transfused 1 unit of packed RBCs for a
hemtocrit of 27.6. The Acute Pain Service continued to follow
the patient for management of the epidural catheter. He was
admitted to the CSRU for a day after surgery and was transferred
to the floor on [**7-26**] after he was deemed to be stable. His chest
tubes were placed to water seal, and a chest radiograph showed
very slight increase in left pneomothorax.

On [**7-27**], his anterior chest tube which was placed
intraoperatively was removed without incident, and his second
tube was put to bulb suction. A chest radiograph that was done
after these changes were made showed no acute or concerning
changes in the left pneumothorax. His epidural catheter was
removed and he was given oral pain medications.

On [**7-28**], the patient's foley catheter was discontinued, but the
patient failed to void 12 hours after removal. He was
administered tamsulosin and his foley catheter was replaced. A
PA and lateral chest radiograph showed decreased left-sided
pneumothorax and interstitial edema since the prior examination,
with small bilateral pleural effusions.

On [**2183-7-29**], he underwent a video swallow study which revealed a
left vocal cord paralysis. The speech consultant recommended the
following:
1.  Diet of thin liquids and soft solids
2. Swallow w/chin tucked to chest for all consistencies
3.  Pills whole in applesauce
4.  ENT consult to evaluate vocal cord mobility to r/o Left
    vocal cord paresis/paralysis

An otolaryngology consult was obtained for evaluation and
treatment for this condition, the recommendation which were to
observe strict chin-tuck adherence and strict aspiration
precautions as the patient was thought to be at great aspiration
risk; and twice-daily proton pump inhibitor. A chest radiograph
performed on [**2183-7-29**] showed further improvement in the small
left apical pneumothorax and improvement in the interstitial
edema.

On [**2183-7-30**], he underwent another voiding trial after his foley
was discontinued, and this time, he voided 500cc. The patient
was discharged to rehabilitation facility in good condition,
with instructions for follow-up care with thoracic surgeon, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and otolaryngologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Imaging:
[**2187-3-26**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis
Impression:
1. Status post sigmoid colectomy and prostatectomy. No
small-bowel
obstruction. Moderate fecal load, limiting the evaluation of
intraluminal
colonic mass but no obstructing mass is noted. No colonic wall
thickening.  No acute diverticulitis.
2. Right inguinal hernia with a loop of non-obstructed small
bowel.
Fat-containing left inguinal hernia.
3. Interval progression of T12 compression fracture since [**2183**]
with now
almost complete loss of vertebral height, but minimal
retropulsion into the spinal canal.
4. Stable left adrenal nodule. Cholelithiasis without acute
cholecystitis.  Unchanged increased lung base interstitial
marking suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.
5. Status post AAA repair with persistent thrombosed [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
6. If clinical concern remains high for colonic mass, recommend
followup with colonoscopy.
.
[**2187-3-27**] CXR
Cardiac size is top normal. There is no change in diffuse
emphysema and
peripheral reticular abnormality, left greater than right,
consistent with
pulmonary fibrosis. There is evidence of loss of volume in the
left lung
consistent with left upper lobe wedge resection. Mild increase
opacity of the left lower lobe is likely atelectasis. There is
no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are no new lung
abnormalities suggestive of pneumonia.
.
[**2187-3-28**]: colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the whole colon. Large
amount of old blood and clots were seen throughout the colon,
but not in the terminal ileum. This is likely a right-sided
diverticular bleed. No active, ongoing bleeding at present.
Limited view of mucosa given extensive old blood.

Brief Hospital Course:
Acute blood loss anemia [**1-9**] GIB: The patient was initially
admitted to the MICU for a GI bleed.  Serial hematocrits were
stable after receiving 2 units of PRBCs from [**3-26**]
(admission)-[**3-27**] and he was transitioned to the regular medical
floor. Pt was maintained with 2 large bore IVs, active type and
screen, consented and crossmatched. His home aspirin and
antihypertensives were held. GI was consulted and recommended
colonoscopy for the morning on [**2187-3-28**].  Colonoscopy showed
multiple diverticuli and bleeding (see above). Overnight on
[**5-3**] pt had 2 episodes large volume BRBPR with HR in 110s.
Pt recieved 2U of PRBCs and did not have further bleeding until
[**3-30**] when he started to have melanotic stools. His hematocrit
was trending down and he was transfused to a hematocrit of >28.
His melana resolved and GI felt an EGD would not be necessary at
this time. It was felt his melana was residual blood from his
previous bleed. In total pt recieved 6 [**Location 2984**] throughout
hospitalization.

# Dementia: continued namenda

# Hypertension: lisinopril and metoprolol were held. They were
held upon discharge as well and based on patient's outpatient
blood work and blood pressure readings, the decision should be
made in the outpatient to restart these medications.

# CAD: aspirin was held

# SC nodule: pt was noted to have a small subcutaneous nodule
very low in LLQ. Pt stated that it had been present for many
years (though pt is variable historian). Management deferred to
primary care provider.

# Prostate/Lung/Colon/Skin cancer: management deferred to outpt
providers.

Discharge Diagnosis:
primary: rectal bleeding
secondary: htn, hypercholesterolemia


Discharge Condition:
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for bleeding for bloody bowel movements. You
had a colonoscopy which showed out-pouchings of your colon
(called diverticulosis) without active bleeding or polyps. The
bleeding initially probably came from one of those outpouchings
but we could not tell which one. After your colonoscopy, you
started having bleeding in your stool again. This time the
bleeding slowed down considerably. Your blood levels remained
stable. It was felt the minimal blood in your stool was residual
blood from your previous bleed. You should follow up with your
outpatient doctor for a re-check of your blood level.

You also had some difficulty with shortness of breath. A CT scan
was performed that did not show any acute concerning causes of
shortness of breath. This may be due to underlying lung disease.
Your oxygen levels were normal while walking. You should follow
up with your doctor for further managment.

When you go home please continue your home medications with the
following changes:
1. HOLD Lisinopril 5 daily
2. HOLD Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
3. HOLD Aspirin 81 mg daily
****These two medications should be re-adjusted at your follow
up visit on [**Hospital1 766**]. Your blood pressure was not elevated and
with concern for bleeding, these were not re-started.***
4. START Protonix 40 mg twice a day. This will help decrease the
acid in your stomach.

It is important that you keep all of your doctor's appointments.

.
Carotid US ([**4-21**]): Extensive plaques involving the left common
carotid artery and bilateral internal and external carotid
arteries with significant stenosis at left internal carotid
artery, 80-99%, common carotid artery, 60-69%, and right
internal carotid artery, 70-79%
.
MRA LEs ([**4-22**]):
1. Moderate-severe atherosclerotic disease of the right common
iliac artery, including a focal high-grade stenosis
approximately 2.6 cm distal to the aortic bifurcation. There is
also moderate-severe disease within the right external iliac and
right common femoral arteries.
2. Occlusion of the distal right common femoral artery and
proximal right superficial femoral artery which extends for
approximately 5 cm. The right profunda femorus artery is patent
and supplies collateral vessels to the more distal right SFA.
3. Diffuse moderate-severe disease of the right superficial
femoral artery, with multiple focal stenoses identified. The
most high-grade disease is in the region of the adductor canal,
focally. The right below-knee popliteal artery od a good quality
vessel, and there is normal 3- vessel runoff to the foot.
4. Moderate disease of the left common iliac artery with
multiple focal stenoses identified.
5. Moderate-severe disease of the left superficial femoral
artery, with multiple focal stenoses identified. The most severe
disease is in the region of the adductor canal.
6. Normal 3-vessel runoff on the left.
.
CXR ([**4-23**]): New moderate-sized left and probable small right
pleural
effusions. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph may be
helpful for initial further assessment when the patient's
condition permits
.
CXR ([**4-24**]): Perihilar and basilar opacities are likely due to
pulmonary edema. Pneumonia is considered less likely.
.
Chest CTA ([**4-24**]): Similar lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum. No
evidence of pulmonary embolism. Areas of air trapping,
ground-glass opacity and slight peripheral septal thickening,
suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension or mild congestive
heart failure, and perhaps obstructive pulmonary disease as
mentioned in the requisition. Increased left effusion. Calcified
posterior wall of left ventricle, unchanged
.
Head CT ([**4-24**]): No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
other acute process.
.

to moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal
infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis. EF 40%. Inferior
akinesis and basal infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis

.
CXR ([**4-27**]): Interval improvement in right middle and upper lobe
opacities, likely representing improved pulmonary edema
.
CXR ([**4-28**]): Worsening pulmonary edema with moderate bilateral
pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**4-30**]): Endotracheal tube is 8 cm above carina. NG tube is in
proximal body of stomach. Left subclavian CV line has tip
located in region of cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax. There
is a left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis in the
left lung zone, unchanged since the prior film of [**2135-4-28**].
.
CXR ([**5-1**]): The superior portion of the chest is obscured by the
flexed neck and chin. Tip of endotracheal tube is difficult to
localize on this film, as is the NG tube. There is a left
pleural effusion and ill-defined opacity in the left lower zones
consistent with associated atelectasis. Left subclavian CV line
has tip in region of cavoatrial junction. No definite
pneumothorax. Repeat
film may be obtained for better localization of endotracheal
tube and NG tube if clinically indicated.
.
CXR ([**5-3**]): No endotracheal tube present. Nasogastric tube ends
in a mildly distended stomach. Small bilateral pleural effusions
improved substantially since [**5-1**]. Borderline interstitial
edema, improved. Heart size normal. Left subclavian central
venous line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax. Status post right upper rib resections.


Brief Hospital Course:
79yo M with MMP including DMII, CAD s/p MI, PVD, COPD, multiple
malignancies, hypercholesterolemia, and HTN who was admitted to
vascular with toe pain, but then developed hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
# ICU COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to his cardiologist's office
with 7-10 days of increasing pain in his R foot, specifically
his R second toe. His exam at the time was felt to be consistent
with ischemia or cellulitis. His cardiologist referred to the
hospital and he was admitted to the vascular service. He was
started on IV antibiotics (kefzol and flagyl) and a wound
culture grew MSSA. XR showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Noninvasive vascular studies were performed as the patient was a
known vasculopath and it was assumed that an intervention would
need to be performed to preserve his toe. Studies revealed that
he had extensive plaques in the L common carotid artery,
bilateral internal and external carotid arteries, as well as
significant bilateral iliac, superficial femoral, and tibial
disease. There was retrograde flow in the L vertebral artery
indicating L subclavian steal. On [**4-21**], while on the vascular
service, he developed nausea and vomiting while moving around
for all of his studies. He was given reglan and anzemet for his
nausea, as well as percocet for his toe pain. He did well until
[**4-23**] when he began to have labored breathing and a decreased O2
sat to 81%. He was felt to be wheezing and he was given
nebulizers with good effect. However, he was then found to be
very tachycardic, with a lot of ectopy on telemetry. He was
given IV metoprolol for his tachycardia, but overnight, again
developed respiratory distress. EKG was unchanged from priors.
It was decided to electively intubate him as his RR was in the
30s-40s and his sats were only in the low 90s on a NRB. His ABG
at the time was 7.14/71/72. He was given 20mg lasix IV and 80mg
IV solumedrol, but he remained in respiratory distress so he was
transferred to the SICU for intubation. He was sedated and CT of
his chest and head were performed to look for causes of his SOB.
CT of his head revealed no intracranial pathology, and the CTA
was negative for PE, but did reveal that he had pleural
effusions. BNP was elevated at the time, so he was given
additional lasix.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated the following evening, with the hope
that treatment for CHF and COPD would have improved his
respiratory status. He did well overnight, but again developed
tachypnea acutely on the morning of [**2135-4-25**], associated with
wheezing and hypoxia. He was given nebulizer treatments x3,
solumedrol, and lasix with no improvement. Serial ABGs at the
time revealed 7.35/43/63/25/-1 (post-extubation) ->
7.08/81/62/-8 (during his distress) -> 7.28/41/246/-6(post
intubation). On [**2135-4-25**], a TTE was performed which revealed left
ventricular systolic function of ~40%, which was considered to
be moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal
infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis. An attempt was
made at thoracentesis given his bilateral pleural effusions,
however the IP team did not feel that they could get a good view
through which to tap. An NGT was inserted and tubefeeds were
started.  On [**2135-4-26**], the decision was made to discontinue the
patient's beta-blocker because of increased wheezing. The
patient's cardiologist instead recommended using verapamil
instead for rate control.
.
Attempt was made at his second extubation on [**2135-4-26**], but again
he became acutely tachypneic, tachycardic and hypertensive, with
his O2 sats again dropping into the 80s. At this point, he was
reintubated and diuresis was continued. Cardiac enzymes were
cycled x3 and were negative. EP was consulted on [**2135-4-27**] and felt
that the arrhythmias he was having were consistent with episodes
of MAT/afib, with no episodes of sustained ventricular rhythms.
EP confirmed that the patient needed to be on a beta-blocker,
not a CCB, and brought up the issue of anticoagulation.  They
also recommended continuing with diuresis and attempting
extubation again only after his pulmonary edema had resolved. He
was also started on afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor.
On [**2135-4-28**], a bronchoscopy was performed for further evaluation
of his copious, thick, blood-tinged secretions and to see if
there is an anatomical reason that Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unable to be
weaned off the vent. BAL culture results were significant for
gram negative rods, raising the concern for ventilator
associated pneumonia. He performed an SBT on [**4-28**], but developed
tachypnea and tachycardia after just 2 hrs. He was then
transferred to the MICU for help with achieving stable
extubation.
.
In the MICU, his antibiotics were broadened to cover for
Pseudomonas in his sputum (with levaquin and ceftazidime) and he
was given vancomycin for gram positive cocci from his R toe
(which turned out to be MSSA). He was started on an ACE
inhibitor for improved BP control as well as standing nebulizers
and steroids for treatment of his COPD. An insulin gtt was added
to better control his hyperglycemia. Diuresis was continued and
his respiratory status improved. He was able to come down to
pressure support. He passed a SBT and was extubated successfully
on [**2135-5-1**]. He was able to maintain his oxygenation with 40-50%
FiO2 by shovel mask. He was transferred to the floor on [**2135-5-2**]
and by the morning of [**2135-5-3**], he was down to 2L by nasal
cannula.
.
# PNEUMONIA: He underwent a BAL on [**2135-4-28**] which grew a
pansensitive Pseudomonas. Mr. [**Known lastname **] completed an 8 day course
of ceftazidime (along with 7 days of levaquin, for double
coverage initially) for the treatment of Pseudomonas ventilator
associated pneumonia on [**2135-5-7**]. He continued to have a
productive cough, but his oxygenation improved. He was able to
maintain stable O2 sats of 100% on 2L by nc, but still was
mildly hypoxemic on RA (91%). CXR showed that he still has small
residual pleural effusions that are resolving.
.
# COPD: Mr. [**Known lastname **] likely had a COPD exacerbation that
contributed to his difficulty in weaning off of the ventilator.
However, he was able to be changed from IV solumedrol to PO
prednisone on the floor. The prednisone taper was started on
discharge and his steroids will be slowly tapered over two
weeks. He was continued on standing albuterol and ipratroprium
nebulizers as he easily became wheezy with any exertion. He was
also given albuterol inhalers prn. There was some concern, as
[**Known lastname 4030**] above, that his beta-blocker worsened his respiratory
status, but the patient seemed to tolerate oral metoprolol
without any exacerbation of his COPD.
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Mr. [**Known lastname 5024**] WBC began to rise on the floor, at
the same time that he began to have diarrhea. Given that he was
on several antibiotics at the time, there was concern for C diff
infection. Stool studies were sent x2 and were negative for C
diff. He was started on flagyl for empiric treatment of C. diff
and cultures were followed. ID was consulted for advice in the
length of treatment for his Pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as
advise for the treatment of his R toe. ID felt that his
ceftazidime could be discontinued after 8 days, that
levofloxacin was no longer needed for double coverage, and that
his R toe did not look infected, so  vancomycin could also be
discontinued. Ceftazidime was completed on [**2135-5-7**] and per ID,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be continued on flagyl until [**5-10**]. Stool
cultures were sent, including C diff toxin B, which was still
pending upon discharge.
.
# ARRHYTHMIA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have various sinus
arrhythmias in the ICU, possibly MAT vs sinus tachycardia with
ectopic beats. He was given beta-blocker for his tachycardia,
but in the ICU, there was concern that the beta-blocker was
worsening his wheezing and COPD, so it was discontinued.
Verapamil was tried instead, but Mr. [**Known lastname **] became very
tachycardic without beta-blockade. EP was consulted while the
patient was in the ICU and recommended discontinuing the
verapamil and going back to metoprolol, which the team did with
improvement in controlling his rate. On transfer to the floor,
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5025**] was continued on telemetry and appeared to have
multiple different rhythms, including MAT, sinus tachycardia
with ectopic beats (both ventricular and atrial) and ventricular
bigeminy. He had episodes of NSVT, maximum of 14 beats, but
remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic throughout all
episodes. His attending recommended increasing the beta-blockade
if possible, but his blood pressure was on the lower side, so he
was maintained on metoprolol 75mg PO TID with adequate rate
control.
.
# PVD: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a long history of claudication. On
admission, there was concern for cellulitis vs. gangrene in his
R toe.  MRA showed moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease,
but no surgical intervention was planned during this admission
due to his tenous respiratory status. Mr. [**Known lastname **] prefers to have
the summer to heal and would like to pursue whatever
intervention is necessary in the fall. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] is aware of
his decision and plans to follow him as an outpatient for now.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5025**] will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] 2-3 weeks after
discharge.
.
# DM type II: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had been on an insulin gtt in ICU, with
labile fingersticks. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help control his
hyperglycemia in the setting of acute illness and the
administration of tube feeds. On the floor, he was changed back
to SC insulin, but became hypoglycemic on the recommended
regimen. His steroid use for his COPD exacerbation and
discontinuation of tube feeds likely contributed to the lability
of his glycemic control. He did have a symptomatic episode of
hypoglycemia on the morning of [**2135-5-7**] which quickly resolved
with the administration of 1/2amp of D50. He was discharged on
glipizide 5mg daily, which is half of his normal home dose, as
well as a humalog insulin sliding scale while he is still on
prednisone. His glipizide will be titrated as needed at rehab
based on his fingersticks.
.
# FEN: In the ICU, he had an NGT through which he was given tube
feeds. On transfer to the floor, he was reevaluated by speech
and swallow and passed, so he was given  a regular, [**Doctor First Name **], heart
healthy diet with thin liquids and soft solids. He needed no
additional IVF upon transfer to the floor. His electrolytes were
checked daily and were repleted prn.
.
# PPX: He received heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis, a PPI for GI
prophylaxis, and a bowel regimen prn.
.
# ACCESS: He had a left subclavian line placed in the ICU on
[**2135-4-25**]. He had a PICC line placed in his R forearm [**2135-5-3**] and
the SC line was pulled on [**2135-5-4**]. After completion of his
antibiotic course, his PICC line was pulled and he was able to
have a peripheral IV.

Dopplerable bilaterally. The right dorsalis pedis is absent.
The right posterior tibialis is a Dopplerable signal only.
The left DP and PT are Dopplerable. Neurological exam: He is
oriented x3, nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. He was prepared for a right carotid endarterectomy.
He underwent this on [**2135-8-16**]. He tolerated the
procedure well. He was transferred to the post anesthesia
care unit neurologically intact and stable. He required Neo-
Synephrine drip for low urinary output. Patient's
postoperative hematocrit was 31.7, BUN 16, creatinine 0.9.
Patient continued to do well. Postoperative day 1 his Neo-
Synephrine was weaned. His diet was advanced as tolerated. He
did have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia but they
were nonsustained and his Neo-Synephrine dose was decreased.
He was restarted on his home medications and the Neo was
weaned. Patient remained in the VICU. He was preopped for
potential right leg revascularization with a femoral-femoral
bypass but developed florid flash pulmonary edema and
required admission to the SICU. He was intubated for
respiratory insufficiency and his oxygenation improved. He
continued on his Neo and Unasyn for his foot. He was
transfused for his hematocrit of 28.5. He remained in the
SICU. He was followed by his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient
was aggressively diuresed and metoprolol was used for his
supraventricular tachycardia. Patient was extubated on
postoperative day 3. He continued to do well and he was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
His hematocrit remained stable post transfusion. His
creatinine was remained stable with diuresis. His diet was
advanced from clears to as tolerated on postoperative day 4.
Ambulation was begun on postoperative day 4. Neck staples
were discontinued on postoperative day 5. Patient continued
to do well. Patient had an episode of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. He was asymptomatic. He was sleeping
in a chair. Postoperative day 6 his blood pressure was 70/50
after being placed back in bed but 15 minutes later his blood
pressure was 122/50. His O2 saturation was 96% on 2 liters by
nasal cannula. An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed
no acute changes. He was continued to be monitored. Enzymes
were sent. Those were unremarkable. Electrolytes were checked
and those were stable and did not require any repletion.
Because of this episode cardiology was requested to see the
patient to determine whether he would be okay to undergo a
major surgical procedure given his cardiac status. An
echocardiogram was obtained. This demonstrated left atrial
enlargement. The left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was moderately
depressed with inferior and lateral akinesis with anterior
and septal hypokinesis. The aortic valve was mildly thickened
with three leaflets. The mitral valve was mildly thickened.
There was mild mitral regurgitation. Compared to a previous
study done in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year the left ventricular function
had decreased. The patient underwent a stress test in which
he had no anginal symptoms or electrocardiographic changes
from baseline. A nuclear study demonstrated left ventricular
cavity size was mildly enlarged. The resting and stress
perfusion images revealed severe fixed inferior and lateral
wall defect. There was also a moderate reversible apical
defect with a calculated ejection fraction of 25%. These
findings were reviewed with his cardiologist. After a long
discussion the cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and the patient
determined that he was at very high risk for a perioperative
event. The patient elected to proceed to have surgery on his
right leg for his ischemic right rest pain, even with
significant increased risk.

Patient underwent on [**2135-8-26**] a right common femoral
artery endarterectomy with saphenous vein angioplasty,
angiogram of the aorta and right iliac arteries. Patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post
anesthesia care unit stable with Dopplerable DP and PT on the
right and the foot was pink with 2 to 3 second capillary
refill. Postoperatively the patient remained hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. Postoperative day #1 there were no
overnight events. The patient's diet was advanced as
tolerated. His fluids were hep-locked. He was gently diuresed
with Lasix and ambulation to a chair was begun. Cardiology
continued to follow the patient. He continued on his beta
blockers. Spirolactone was added daily for blood pressure and

transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on [**8-15**] from [**Hospital 487**] Hospital for
VF arrest on [**8-14**], shocked in the field.

Pt was in her USOH until [**8-14**]. In the evening she cooked dinner
for her husband, then watched a movie and went to bed. At around
1am, she woke her husband up with substernal chest pain. She
thook sublingual NTG, which resolved the pain immediately.
Approximately 15minutes later, the patient again experience
chest pain. Her husband called 911, and by the time he returned
to her side, she began to slump in her chair and became
unconscious, eyes ""rolling back"", no incontinence. EMS arrived 2
minutes after this episode, found her to be in v-fib and
proceeded to electric defibrillation. The shock resulted in a
perfusing rhythm. She was intubated in the field, received 200mg
IV lidocaine and was started on IV fluids. She was taken to
[**Hospital6 3105**], where she was started on dopamine for
persistent hypotension. She was also started on heparin and
eptifibatide drips for ACS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent
cardiac cath.

At [**Hospital1 18**], she was taken immediately to the cath lab where she
was found to have moderate 3 vessel disease with a ""hazy lesion""
in OM-1 that was stented with a BMS. Concomitant TTE verified
severe global left ventricular dysfunction (EF ~20-25%), repeat
documented improvement with Ef ~45%.

CARDIOLOGY:
.
CARDIAC CATH ([**2119-8-15**]):
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Hypotensive shock with elevated filling pressures, elevated
cardiac
index and depressed SVR.
3. Echocardiographic evidence of severe left ventricular
systolic heart
failure.
4. Severe biventricular diastolic heart failure.
5. Severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.
6. Severe hypercapnea and acidemia despite aggressive
ventilation.
7. Successful placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal
OM1.
8. Unsuccessful angioplasty (balloon inflation not attempted) of
the OM
distal branch, left posterolateral branch of the circumflex, and
acute
marginal branch of the RCA.
.
TTE ([**8-15**]):
There is severe global left ventricular dysfunction with more
severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral
walls and mid to distal anteroseptum. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The severity of the
regurgitation may be underestimated. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery pressure cannot be determined.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe global hypokinesis
with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mid to
distal anterior septum c/w multivessel CAD. Distal right
ventricular hypokinesis. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
LVEF 20-25%.
.
TTE ([**2119-8-23**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Complex atheroma
in the descending aorta. The aortic arch was not well visualized
but probably also has atheroma.
.
TTE ([**2119-8-30**]):
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve is
not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-8-16**],
overall left ventricular function has improved. The right
ventricle is no longer dilated and has improved overall
function. The RV apical free wall is still hypokinetic although
has improved from prior echo. Estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressures are slightly higher on the current study.
.
RADIOLOGY:
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2119-8-15**]):
IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute infarct. No hemorrhage.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2119-8-21**]):
1. Large hypoattenuating areas in the left occiptal lobe and the
superior
portions of the left of the cerebellum. There are also two small
foci of
hypoattenuation bilaterally in the frontal lobes. Overall, this
suggests
development of multiple embolic infarctions.
.
MRI HEAD and MRA BRAIN/NECK W/O CONTRAST ([**2119-8-22**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal areas of restricted diffusion in the left
cerebellar
hemisphere; left occipital and parietal lobe; midbrain; and
bilateral centrum semiovale consistent with acute infarcts. The
distribution of these infarction is most compatible with an
embolic source.
2. Severely limited MR arteriography of the brain and neck
secondary to
motion. The left vertebral artery is not seen. Note is made of
possible
narrowing at the origin of the M2 segment on the right. The
right mid and
proximal vertebral artery and distal basilar arteries are
patent; however, the proximal basilar and distal vertebral
arteries are not assessed. The left ECA is occluded.
.
MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST ([**2119-8-30**]):
IMPRESSION: Vascular narrowing at the origin of the right
internal carotid
artery. The proximal right vertebral artery is patent. The left
vertebral
artery and the left external carotid artery are not visualized
in this
examination. Correlation with CTA of the head and neck is
recommended if
clinically warranted.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY ([**2119-8-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection.
2. Diffuse infiltrative process in the lung, worrisome for
atypical
(bacterial or viral) pneumonia.
3. An episode of aspiration mainly to the posterior segment of
the left upper lobe along with tiny scattered bronchiolar
nodules.
4. Atherosclerotic noncalcified disease of the descending aorta.

5. Lines, tubes, and catheters are in satisfactory location as
described
above.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST ([**2119-8-20**]):
IMPRESSION: Small amount of ascites and right perinephric
stranding, which is nonspecific. Bilateral small pleural
effusions, right greater than left with associated lower lobe
atelectasis. No visualized adrenal or paraspinal masses.
.
MRI CHEST/MEDIASTINUM W/O CONTRAST ([**2119-8-24**]):
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. Minimal atherosclerosis in
the aorta.
2. Limited visualization of the great vessels on the current
study.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS W+W/O CONTRAST
1. Bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] like
appearance that is suspicious for possible aspiration or other
infectious etiology.
2. No source for abdominal pain localized on this study.
.
RIJ Central line placement ([**2119-8-15**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to
the upper to mid portion of the SVC. Swan-Ganz catheter inserted
from below extends to the pulmonary outflow tract. Nasogastric
tube extends to the stomach, though the side hole lies above the
esophagogastric junction. Some increasing prominence of
interstitial markings suggests overhydration. There may be
minimal atelectatic changes at the left base.

IMPRESSION: Right PICC line terminating in the upper SVC
.
RUQ U/S ([**2119-8-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study. No focal liver lesions identified.
2. Gallbladder polyp.
3. Trace of ascites.
.
RENAL U/S ([**2119-8-21**]):
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Normal appearance of renal
parenchyma and
cortices with symmetric sizes.
.
CXR PA & Lat ([**2119-9-1**]): AICD placement, V leads in normal
position, no PTX (prelim read)

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Known lastname 9581**] is a 54 y/o F with DM2, HTN, 3vCAD (s/p
MI s/p RCA stent in [**2110**]), EtOH and tobacco abuse, h/o
depression/[**Hospital 9582**] transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-15**] from [**Hospital 487**]
Hospital for VF arrest on [**8-14**] s/p electric shock in field. Pt
was initially treated in the CCU, then transferred to the MICU
for management of respiratory failure, hypertension and
newly-diagnosed embolic strokes, and finally transferred to the
medicine floor for observation and AICD device placement.
.
1) Respiratory failure/Aspiration PNA:
The pt initially was difficult to ventilate in the CCU. DDx of
resp failure included PE (CTA negative, but did show diffuse b/l
pulm infiltrates), COPD (baseline, med non-compliance, wheezes
on exam), pneumonia (sputum Cx negative, on Abx), aspiration
(pre-/post-cardioversion, radiographic findings suggestive). The
pt was empirically treated with steroids out of concern for a
COPD flair, as well as nebulizer treatments. In this setting,
after several days, her respiratory status finally imporved and
she was able to be extubated on [**2119-8-23**]. Post extubation the pt
did very well with minimal oxygen requirements. Her RA O2 sat
was 95-100%. Steroid taper was initiated, to be continued
through [**2119-9-5**]. Pt was discharged on home
albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
.
2) Hypetertension:
In the CCU, the pt was intermittently noted to be hypertensive
into the 200s- reportedly alternating SBPs from 140s to 320.
Alcohol withdrawal considered, as well as RAS (normal renal u/s)
and pheochromocytoma (normal torso CT). Repeat CT today showed
new embolic infarcts in L occipital lobe, L frontal lobe. Neuro
consulted, pt started on nicardipine gtt, pt transferred to MICU
for ongoing management of her newly diagnosed stroke,
respiratory failure and hypertension. Given her recent CVAs,
neuro advised a goal BP of the 140s-160s. In the ICU, the pt was
managed with captopril and HCTZ; she briefly required a
nicardipine gtt to control her BP. On the floor, her SBPs ranged
in the 100-150s range, she was continued on HCTZ 25mg PO daily,
lisinopril 30mg PO daily, Toprol XL 25mg PO daily. On discharge,
she was normotensive.
.
3) Embolic stroke:
Head CT for evaluation of HTN on [**8-22**] revealed new embolic
infarcts in L occipital lobe, L frontal lobe. The findings were
confirmed with MRI/MRA. Pt had a h/o CEA in [**2118**] and the neck
MRA revealed some narrowing in the R carotid artery, however,
the strokes seemed to be of embolic origin given the CAD,
presentation, and distribution. They most likely happened in the
context of her VFib and defibrillation, as their appearance in
the CT scan points towards subacute events. Thus, pt was kept on
ASA and clopidogrel, but no anticoagulation was started on
discharge. Pt's neurological exam significant for R sided
weakness and peripheral vision loss. Sensation grossly intact,
ambulation is difficult (rehab was recommended, but pt refused).
.
4) Leukocytosis:
The pt was noted to have an elevated WBC count over the course
of her hospital stay. Given concern for aspiration around the
time of the pt's defibrillation in the field, and given
radiographic findings consistent with this, the pt was treated
with Zosyn for an 8 day course. Her initial treatment at time of
presentation also included levofloxacin and vancomycin, however
these were stopped based on negative culture results. On
transfer to the medicine floor, her WBC count downtrended
(31.8--> 15.3, 18.4 on discharge s/p AICD placement).
.
Note: B-Glucan positive 360 (>80), Galactomannan negative. Tests
repeated with similar findings, however fungal blood cx remained
negative. Zosyn could give a false positive for galactomannan
(which was negative)([**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] J Med. [**2114**] [**12-14**];349(24):2366-7.),
but this has not been reported for B-glucan (Antimicrob Agents
Chemother. [**2117**] [**Month (only) 359**]; 50(10): 3450??????3453).
.
5) CAD/Ischemia:
Patient has prior history of inferior MI, with 3VD (diffuse 50%
stenosis) on cardiac catheterization performed on day of
admission. Cardiac catheterization revealed non-occlusive
disease, and picture felt not to be consistent with ACS.
Stenting of OM1 undertaken (not felt to be culprit lesion). The
pt was continued on ASA 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily,
atorvastatin 80 mg daily. A beta blocker was held in the setting
of bronchospams on exam, however low-dose metoprolol was started
on [**2119-8-25**] which the pt appeared to tolerate well. Pt discharged
on aspirin, beta-blocker, ace-i, and statin. Given 3vCAD, CABG
evaluation in the future is to be considered. Since the stroke
seems to have occured in the setting of v-fib/electric
defibrillation, it is not thought to be a contra-indication to
possible CABG, once pt is medically stabilized and improved.
.
6) Arrhythmia/V-fib:
Pt was in sinus rhythm with occasional PVC and asymptomatica
tachycardic episodes associated with movement. Given extensive
CAD and recent episode of v-fib, pt is at very high risk for a
recurrence, therefore an AICD (VVI) was placed on [**2119-8-31**]. Pt
to be followed regularly by electrophysiology clinic.
.
7) Acute systolic CHF:
Pt had a LVEF of 20-25% on admission in the setting of acute MI,
v-fib and cardioversion. LVEF improved to >55% by the time of
discharge.
.
8) DM2:
The pt's metformin was held and she was managed with standing
insulin and a sliding scale while in house. Her blood sugar
ranged in the 150-300 range while on prednisone. On discharge
she was restarted on metformin 850mg [**Hospital1 **], to be optimized as an
outpatient once prednisone entirely tapered and pt on her home
diet.
.
9) Depression/Anxiety/PTSD:
Pt has an extensive history of substance use/abuse as well as
depression/PTSD/anxiety. On transfer to the medicine floor from
the ICU, she experienced several episodes of anxiety, which
prompted her to refuse treatments at times and threaten to leave
AMA. She was treated with reassurance and lorazepam. Her
outpatient lamotrigine was not continued on discharge. Pt was
instructed to follow up with her outpatient psychiatrist for
optimal management.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you had a cardiac arrest
at home. You were found to have a very serious arrhythmia
(ventricular fibrillation), for which you received electric
defibrillation shock before arriving to the hospital. At the
hospital, you were evaluated and treated with cardiac
catheterization and stenting for coronary artery disease. You
were observed in the intensive care unit and were found to have
a stroke most likely due to cholesterol-plaques dislodged from
the electric shock during resuscitation. Your hospital course
was also complicated by respiratory failure, for which you were
intubated, aspiration pneumonia, which we treated with
antibiotics. Because of the extremely high risk of developing a
lethal arrhythmia again, an automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator was placed.
.
We recommend that you follow up with your physicians very
closely (see below). We recommended that you go to
rehabilitation after discharged from the hospital, however, you
refused to go. Therefore, if you go home, you should restart
your activities very carefully and have somebody with you at all
times, given your severe medical conditions and very high risk
of fall and injury. You should not drive and should not perform
any major activity by yourself, unless you talk to a physician.
.
Your medications have been changed as follows:
- we stopped your lamotrigine (lamictal) while you were in the
hospital and we recommend that you talk to your psychiatrist
before restarting it
- started you on aspirin 325mg PO daily and clopidogrel 75mg PO
daily, please do not stop taking these medications unless
directed to do so by your cardiologist
- started atorvastatin 80mg PO daily for your lipid control
- started metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily for your heart
disease
- started lisinopril 30mg PO daily for your blood pressure
- started hctz 25mg PO daily for your blood pressure
- continued metformin 850mg PO BID for your diabetes, please
follw up with your physican on how to control your blood sugar
optimally
- started oxycodone and acetaminophen as needed for pain
- started docusate for your bowel movements while on opioid pain
killers
- started thiamine and folic acid vitamins
- started pantoprazole for heart burn
- continued lorazepam as needed for anxiety
- continued SLNTG as needed for chest pain, please call 911
immediately, if you your chest pain lasts after 3 tablets taken
15 minutes apart.
- continued your prednisone taper through [**9-5**]
- started cephalexin 500mg PO q6h for 3 days after AICD
placement
- started albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatment
.
Please stop smoking. Information on smoking cessation was given
to you on admission.
.
Please call your physician immediately if you have fever,
headache, new neurological deficits, chest pain, shortness of
breath, dizziness, or any other symptoms that concern you.

Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion, atrial fibrillation with RVR.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 77-year old male with minimal prior medical care
for over 50 years, with no known past medical problems, who was
brought to the [**Name (NI) **] this morning by his social worker because he
was noted to have labored breathing.  He minimizes his symptoms,
and reports that he has been feeling ""great"" and has no
complaints.  Per his social worker, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1968**], she has noted a
deterioration in his health over the last 2 weeks.  Her main
concern has been with his balance.  He has been having trouble
maintaining his balance on ambulating for several weeks.  He has
had several falls recently due to difficulty with his balance
and has been walking with a cane for the last 3 weeks.  He
recalls his last fall to have been approximately 1 week ago.  He
denies any prodromal symptoms with this fall including no
lightheadedness, LOC, chest pain, SOB, and palpitations.   His
social worker also notes that he has had decreased appetite with
minimal PO intake for the last few days.  She notes that on her
visit today, he looked pale and had difficulty breathing.  He
denies difficulty breathing and other complaints including no
chest pain, palpitations, SOB, orthopnea, LE edema and PND.
.
In the ED he was noted to have atrial fibrillation to 140-160s
with SBP 145/65.  He was given 5 mg IV diltiazem without
response and started on a diltiazem gtt.  He had an
echocardiogram that was done by ED staff that revealed a
pericardial effusion.  He had a formal echocardiogram that
showed a moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) and no evidence of
tamponade, though limited by suboptimal study due to RVR.  He is
being admitted to the CCU with atrial fibrillation with
difficult to control RVR on diltiazem 15 mg/hour.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2174-9-29**]):
There is diffuse symmetric enlargement of the ventricles and
sulci consistent with mild-to-moderate age-related atrophy.
There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
large vascular territory infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Paranasal sinuses and ethmoid air
cells are normally pneumatized and clear. There is a small
heterogeneous lucency within the left parieto-occipital
calvarium (2:24). This likely represents a hemangioma. The
osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for hemorrhage or other acute
intracranial process.
.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2174-9-29**]):
There is asymmetric interstitial septal thickening with some
nodularity involving the entire right lung. Multiple pulmonary
nodules in the lungs are also identified measuring 8 mm (series
4:100). There is bilateral atelectasis and moderate simple
fluid-attenuating effusions. There are multiple mildly enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 12 mm(precarinal, series
4, image 96). Although evaluation is limited without contrast,
there is increased soft tissue in the right hilum concerning for
adenopathy such as increased soft tissue posterior to the right
main bronchus (series 4:125). Calcified mediastinal and small
right hilar nodes also noted. No left hilar adenopathy is
identified. There are coronary artery calcifications. Study was
not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but no
abnormalities are identified. Please note that the adrenal
glands were not imaged. No suspicious lesions are identified in
the osseous structures, which otherwise demonstrate diffuse
degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION:
1. Constellation of findings including asymmetric nodular right
lung
interstitial septal thickening, mediastinal and right hilar
adenopathy, and multiple pulmonary nodules are concerning for
possible malignant disease, but no definite primary tumor site
is identified. Consider PET CT for further assessment, if
warranted clinically.
2. Large pericardial effusion.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-9-28**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears borderline depressed
(difficult to assess to very rapid and irregular pulse). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a moderate sized pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized
within the pericardial space c/w organization. No right atrial
or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumfirential pericardial effusion
without tamponade. LV/RV systolic function are preserved
(difficult to assess due to irregular and very rapid pulse)
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2174-9-29**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized
within the pericardial space c/w organization. The effusion is
most prominent posterior to the left ventricle, with <1 cm
anterior to the right ventricle in diastole. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta. Moderate
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2174-9-28**] LV function appear normal (largely
secondary to a lower ventricular response rate in atrial
fibrillation). Aortic regurgitation is slightly more prominent,
also likely secondary to longer diastolic period.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 77-year old gentleman with no prior
medical history who presents with a pericardial effusion and
atrial fibrillation with RVR.  He was started on a diltiazem
drip and admitted to the CCU for closer monitoring given his
rapid ventricular rate.
..
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  On echocardiogram, he was found to have
a moderate-sized effusion (2 cm).  Given his hemodynamic
stability, we suspected that this was a chronic process.  A
repeat echo showed little interval progression.   After
evaluation of echo findings and symptoms, we felt that the
effusion was not affecting hemodynamics in any marked way.  By
symptoms he was never hypotensive or showing clinical signs of
tamponade.
.
We checked [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] and PPD, both of which returned negative.  We
order a CT chest to evaluate his lung fields and possibly shed
light on the etiology of the pericardial effusion.  The full CT
report is above; in brief, it showed interstitial septal
thickening, as well as mediastinal LAD and pulmonary nodules,
all highly concerning for malignancy (primary site not
identified).  Thus the pericardial effusion was felt to be due
to metastatic cancer.
.
We discussed the findings with Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] and explained to him
that further work-up to diagnose and potentially treat his
condition would involve tissue biospy and additional imaging.
He was not interested in more work-up and expressed desire to go
home.  See below for more information.
..
# CAD/ISCHMIA:  We did not suspect ischemic disease as he had no
risk factors, symptoms or EKG changes to suggest ACS.
Furthermore, echocardiogram did not show any focal hypokinesis
or akinesis to suggest myocardial infarction.
..
# PUMP:  There were so signs of fluid overload or clinical pump
failure on physical exam.  His echocardiogram showed a normal EF
of 55-60%.
..
# RHYTHM:  He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR that
required a diltiazem drip in the emergency room.  He converted
back to sinus rhythm on the morning after admission.
Unfortunately, he returned to AF intermittently throughout his
hospital stay.  We started him on PO metoprolol and diltiazem;
however, he continued to have periods of AF with ventricular
response to 90-110s while lying in bed.  At time of discharge,
his rate is 80-100 while lying in bed and increases to 150s when
he is walking.  His systolic blood pressure and oxygen sat are
120s and mid to low 90s, respectively, during these episodes.
He remains asymptomatic.
.
We discussed starting anticoagulation, but felt that it was
unnecessary and potentially harmful in this patient with a
CHADS-2 score of 1 (age), potential medical non-compliance
(history of homelessness), and significant fall risk (history of
multiple mechanical falls in recent weeks).  We started him on
aspirin at a dose of 325 mg once daily.
..
# HISTORY OF FALLS:  History as above seemed most consistent
with mechanical falls due to balance and gait problems.  [**Name (NI) **] loss
of consciousness or cardiac prodromal symptoms to suggest
arrhythmic cause, although certainly AF could be contributing to
his generalized weakness and propensity to fall. Neurologic exam
was nonfocal and CT was negative for acute process.
.
He was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehab.  However,
he declined this option; in the end he left against medical
advice so that he could return home.  We arranged for him to
have a walker as well as home PT/OT visits and VNA visits.
.
# LOW-GRADE FEVERS / PULMONARY INFILTRATE ON CXR:  He had
persistent fevers overnight with Tm of 101.6.  Chest CT showed
no infiltrate but did show diffuse nodules and adenopathy
concerning for malignancy.  Blood and urine cultures were
negative and there were no localizing symptoms.  White count was
WNL with no bands on the differential.  No source for his fevers
was found, and he was not started on antibiotics.  Further
work-up would require tissue sample of his pericardial effusion
or mediastinal lymph nodes.  At time of discharge, he had
remained afebrile for over 24 hours.
..
# RENAL FAILURE:  Urine electrolyes were consistent with
prerenal azotemia.  His ARF resolved with IVF boluses in ED.
There were no further concerns.
..
# ANEMIA:  Iron, TSH, vitamin B12 and folate studies were
normal.  His anemia is likely secondary to marrow suppression
from his underlying process, most likely a malignancy.
..
# GOALS OF CARE:  These were discussed with Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] when his
underlying disease remained uncertain.  We explained that we
would need a tissue sample to definitively diagnose the cause
for his pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions.
We explained that this would likely provide an explanation for
his presenting symptoms, namely his shortness of breath and
anemia.  He was also seen by physical therapy, who noted that he
was too weak to go home and should be discharged to rehab.
However, it was clear that Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] wanted to return to his
home and was not interested in any invasive procedures, even if
these might reveal a potentially treatable cause for his
symptoms.  We suggested that he consider hospice care, but he
did not want to leave his home for a hospice facility.
.
Prior to leaving, he signed an AMA form.  Eventhough he returns
home against medical advice, he has agreed to have VNA come
visit him, as well as PT/OT, meals on wheels, and elderly
services.  We have provided home oxygen if he needs it during
activities, although his O2 sats have been fine on RA when
walking with walker.  He has confirmed his code status is
DNR/DNI.
..
# He was given a regular diet.  Subcutaneous heparin was used
for DVT prophylaxis.  Code status was discussed and at his
request he was made DNR/DNI.

PND and DOE.  Pt was in his USOH until 2 weeks prior when he
began to have difficulty sleeping due to waking up after
sleeping for ~30 minute with shortness of breath and coughing.
He attempted to sleep propped up with pillows, but he continued
to wake up with dyspnea.  During this time he also noted DOE,
finding himself dyspneic after walking up only 1 flight of
stairs (was able to walk [**3-11**] flights before).  He denies
palpitations, chest pain, lower extremity edema.  He notes that
he had influenza 6 weeks prior which he recovered from without

Brief Hospital Course:
#Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Patient was admitted with new onset
PND and DOE.  He was found to have a dilated cardiomyopathy on
TTE with an ejection fraction of 20%.  SPEP and UPEP were
negative.  No evidence of thyroid dysfunction or
hemochromatosis.  The etiology was thought to be post viral.  He
symptomatically improved while in the hospital and he was
discharged on a low dose of beta-blocker and ACEI.  He may need
a cardiac MRI as an outpatient and should be followed with
serial echos.
.
#Rhythm - While in the hospital, the patient was noted to have a
wide complex tachycardia.  During the episode, he was given IV
metoprolol which cause his blood pressure to drop.  He was
transferred to the CCU because of a concern for unstable VT.
Further review of the EKGs with the EP service determined the
most likely etiology of his rhythm was actually a sinus
tachycardia with abarrancy.  His heart rate was controlled at
the time of discharge.  He will be followed by the EP service as
an outpatient.

.
[**2115-11-7**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-10-21**],
there is worsening in right ventricular function with more right
ventricular dilation, increased severity of tricuspid
regurgitation, and increased estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o male with a h/o COPD on 6L home O2 (FEV1 28% predicted),
recurrent DVT on coumadin, and recently diagnosed LUL NSCLC who
was admitted with hypotension, new AF, and ARF. The patient was
initially admitted to the intensive care unit for hypotension,
which was thought due to a combination of dehydration and
adrenal insufficiency (patient had finished a steroid taper the
day before). After volume expansion and steroids, he was then
transferred to the floor on a steroid taper. He then developed
hypoxia worsening about [**11-16**] and had another brief few days in
the intensive care unit on stress dose steroids for respiratory
monitoring before he was transferred back to the oncology floor.
He has remained afebrile and feeling well on the floor except
for two episodes of obtundation due to the combination of
steroids, trazodone and ambien.
.
1. Dysphagia
Pt had issues with pain on swallowing and a ""feeling of food
getting stuck in chest/epigastrium"" ongoing for several weeks
which seemed to worsene over the admission. A barium swallow was
performed and there was no evidence of stricture or obstruction.
He had evidence of thrush in his mouth and he was empirically
treated with a course of fluconazole for presumed [**Female First Name (un) **]
esophagitis, especially in view of his recent intake of high
dose steroids. EGD was briefly considered but was then cancelled
when the patient improved on fluconazole. Speech and swallow
evaluated the patient and he had no issues with swallowing and
was deemed not an aspiration risk. He can continue regular diet
as tolerated.
.
2. Newly diagnosed NSCLC
The patient was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer on
[**9-/2115**] per cytology. He was being admitted for fiducial
electrode placement and he was found to be hypotensive. He did
have the electrodes placed and underwent CyberKnife mapping. He
wlll follow up after discharge for his CyberKnife therapy.
Radiation Oncology followed up the patient in house and
discussed the treatment options with his daughter [**Name (NI) 5464**], who
agreed fully. He has a schedule for cyberknife prior to leaving
the hospital. CTA performed on [**11-23**] to assess for pulmonary
embolism showed some questionably new lesions on the R lung. The
patient will follow with new scan in [**3-29**] weeks.
.
3. Atrial fibrillation
During the patient's admission for hypotension, he was also
found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
rate. He is currently rate controlled with BB and CCB with care
to avoid hypotension. Initially he required diltiazem 30 mg four
times a day for rate control, but then his requirements
decreased to 15 mg qid and then 15 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He is also
anticoagulated for his h/o recurrent DVT and atrial
fibrillation. Target INR goal is [**1-26**], and his INR at discharge
is 2.8.
.
4. Thrush
The patient was treated for thrush and presumed [**Female First Name (un) **]
esophagitis with a course of fluconazole x 7 days, course
completed. He was also started on Nystatin therapy and he will
continue this on discharge.
.
5. Weakness
He worked with physical therapy and he will be discharged to
acute rehab.   Neurology followed the patient from the beginning
for a history of left sided weakness and found no acute issues.
His weakness was thought due to neuropathy, deconditioning and
poor PO intake. The patient was back to his baseline at the time
of discharge.
.
6. COPD/hypoxia
The patient has a h/o severe COPD with FEV1 28% predicted and on
home O2 (6 liters). The patient was continued on his outpatient
medications included his inhalers. He did have episodes of
hypoxia which was attributed to his NSCLC and severe COPD. He
was treated with high dose steroids during this admission for
COPD exacerbation and he will be maintained on 10 mg of
prednisone daily upon discharge, according to the
recommendations of pulmonary consult.  [**10-24**] and 2 he
decompensated briefly requiring NRB mask to maintain his sats. A
CTA was performed which showed no pulmonary embolism. It showed
questionably new nodules on his right chest. required NRB but
for the past 48 hours he has been back to baseline satting low
90s on [**3-28**] L n/c. He has had two ICU stays, one for hypoxia and
one for hypotension. On his second ICU stay, for hypoxia, he was
treated for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia with 3 days of
vancomycin/zosyn, then transitioned to PO levaquin, of which he
has completed a 7 day course during which he has remained
afebrile.
.
7. DVT
The patient has a known h/o DVT on coumadin prior to admission.
He was maintained on anticoagulation for both this and his
atrial fibrillation. His INR has remained therapeutic.
.
8. Hypotension, resolved
This was likely due to volume depletion and atrial fibrillation
resulting in loss of atrial kick.  Relative adrenal
insufficiency is also high on the differential given recent
discontinuation of prednisone.  Sepsis less likely; patient was
afebrile, leukocytosis was at baseline (patient on steroids).
PE less likely given absence of tachycardia, change in oxygen
requirement, or pleuritic chest pain, although patient has
history of DVT.  ACS less likely given lack of acute ST-T
changes on EKG and negative CE.  Patient was started on
Solumedrol 125 mg IV x 3 doses, then slow prednisone taper.  A
TTE was ordered to assess cardiac function (see above).
.
9. CODE status: a meeting with the medical team and his daughter
[**Name (NI) 5464**] clarified issues of treatment plan. Cyberknife and
radiation therapy. The daughter is very insistent the patient is
absolutely DNR/DNI.
.
10. The patient became acutely obtunded and agitated when
sleeping pills were used. These should be avoided

CT head: [**2169-12-5**]
FINDINGS: The study is severely limited due to patient motion.
There is no evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or
mass effect. A small subarachnoid hemorrhage or extraaxial
hematoma cannot be excluded. The ventricles and sulci grossly
appear normal. No large displaced fracture is evident. The
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinus appear to be clear. Left
frontal osteoma is unchanged in appearance. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation appears to be preserved in the images of the
brain that were less degraded by motion.

IMPRESSION: Study limited by patient motion. No large
intracranial hemorrhage identified. Small subarachnoid
hemorrhage or extraaxial hematoma cannot be excluded.
.
CTA chest:
CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: The heart size is
enlarged with severe coronary artery disease and calcification
of the aortic valve. Atherosclerotic calcifications are also
noted in the aorta. There is extensive pulmonary embolism
involving all segments of the right lung. The appearance of the
thrombi is most consistent with acute pulmonary embolism. There
is no radiographic evidence of right heart strain. There are
also no filling defects in the visualized IVC to suggest
extension of renal cell carcinoma as a cause for pulmonary
embolism. Visualization of the lungs is limited by motion
artifact; images were obtained during expiratory phase. There is
suggestion of several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules
that cannot be further evaluated on the current study. There is
also moderate-to-large right and small-to-moderate left simple,
layering pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. There is
also left greater than right subpulmonic effusion. No
mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy is noted. Very limited
views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

There is an old healed fracture of the left lateral fifth rib.
There are no regions of bone destruction suspicious for
metastasis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive acute pulmonary embolism in all segments of the
right lung. The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4281**]
upon completion of the study.
2. Several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules are
suggested on this exam limited by motion. A repeat CT scan as an
outpatient after resolution of these acute setting may be
warranted. However, given that PET CT of [**2169-10-28**] was negative
for metastatic pulmonary lesion, the likelihood of these nodules
representing new metastatic lesions is decreased.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with subpulmonic effusions.
4. Cardiomegaly with severe coronary artery disease.
.
Cardiac Echocardiogram [**2169-12-5**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2168-1-19**], the left ventricular function has
significantly worsened. The aortic stenosis is moderate to
severe. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function.

.
Cardiac cath report: [**2169-12-5**]
HISTORY:   73 yo female with a history of lung cancer,
metastatic
renal cell carcinoma with met to right femur s/p recent
reconstruction
admitted on [**2169-12-5**] with large right-sided pulmonary embolism
with
hypoxia for which she was intubated. With hypotension requiring
pressors
and ST elevations in V1-V4, concern for STEMI and directed to
cath lab
with troponin 0.31. Echo shows EF 15-20% with severe aortic
stenosis.
For coronary evaluation, ?valvuloplasty.
.
Initial angiography revealed an 80% LM stenosis with damping of
the catheter with engagement of the LM and a 70-80% stenosis of
the mid LAD as well. We planned to treat the lesions with direct
stenting. A prowater wire crossed the lesion into the lad with
minimal difficulty. A JL4 provided adequate support for the
procedure. The patient had received iv lytics for her PE in the
emergency department and thus she received prophyactic hpearin
in the cath lab. A 3.5x12mm driver stent was deployed in the LM
at 16 atm and post dilated with a 4x12mm quantum maverick
balloon at 20 atm with excellent result and no evidence of
jailing either the lad or lcx. We then turned our attention to
the mid LAD lesion. A 3.0x24mm driver stent was deployed in the
mid  lad at 9 atm and then post dilated with a 3.0x12mm quantum
maverick balloon at 21 atm. Final angiography revealed 0%
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and
timi 3 flow. The patient remained hypotensive and ventuilated in
critical condition.  Successful  perclose of the right groin at
the end of the case.  As the patient was about to be transported
up to the CCU for further care, the patient went into PEA arrest
with prolonged rescucitation effort. There was difficulty
re-obtaining arterial access but once we did, angiography of LM
revealed patent LM stent. There was absence of flow elsewhere in
the left coronary in the setting of an asystolic heart. Code
efforts were stopped at this time and the patient was pronounced
dead and the family notified.
.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a
proximal 80% stenosis in the LMCA. The LAD had a 70-80% stenosis
in the mid portion with a 50% stenosis at the origin of the
diagonal. The LCX had a 60% stenosis at the origin. The OM1 had
a proximal 80% stenosis. OM2 and OM3 were without obstructive
disease. The RCA had a proximal 80% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right-sided
filling
pressures. The RASP was 22 mm Hg, RVEDP 30 mm Hg, PASP 57 mm Hg,
PCWP 35
mm Hg and LVEDP 40 mm Hg. The cardiac output was 4.6 and cardiac
index
was 2.5 l/min/m2.
3. There was a mean gradient of 23 mm Hg across the aortic valve
with a
calculated area across the aortic valve of 0.73 cm2 consistent
with
severe aortic stenosis.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
.
Successful LM and LAD stenting with a 3.5x12mm driver stent post
dilated
to 4.0mm in the LM and a 3.0x24 driver stent posted to 3.0mm in
the LAD.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and timi 3 flow. Successful right perclose
device.
Subsequent PEA arrest with prolonged but unsuccesful
rescusitative
efforts. The patient died and the family was informed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient transfered to the cath lab.
In the cath lab patient found with 80 % stenosis in the LMCA.
LAD had 70-80% stenosis mid portion and 50% origing of diagonal.
LCX 60% stenosis. OM1 proximal 80% stenosis. RCA 80% stenosis.
Hemodynamics as follow:The RASP was 22 mm Hg, RVEDP 30 mm Hg,
PASP 57 mm Hg, PCWP 35 mm Hg and LVEDP 40 mm Hg. The cardiac
output was 4.6 and cardiac index  was 2.5 l/min/m2. Severe
aortic stenosis was found.
.
LM and LAD were stententeed succesfully. Final angiography
revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection and timi 3 flow
.
After procedure while transfering patiento to stretcher for
transport, patient had a PEA arrest. CPR was initiated.
Prolonged but unsuccessful resucisative efforts were done. Time
of death  5:54 pm. Family was notified and brouth into the room.

feverish without documented elevated temps, and sweats. In PCP's
office also noted to have hypertension and tachycardia. Had
cardiac stress testing trhough PCP which was normal. These
episodes generally last two to three days and go away with
increasing prednisone. He has been off and on prednisone
throughout these months (up to 30-40 mg daily). One month ago

Brief Hospital Course:
63M with history of asthma, type II DM, ?ILD presenting with
shortness of breath, malaise, diarrhea, now admitted to MICU
with respiratory distress.

# Respiratory distress/tachypnea/hypoxia - pulmonary symptoms
felt most consistent with URI / bronchitis in the setting of
viral gastroenteritis as below, triggering asthma
exacerbation/ILD, though could not exclude contribution from
tracheobronchomalacia contributing to chronic cough.   Recent
TTE with some evidence of mild dCHF, and repeat CXR showed some
mild vascular engorgement, but clinical exam more consistent
with reactive airway disease than diastolic CHF at this time.
.
Pt admitted to ICU and treated initially with ceftriaxone,
levaquin, and flagyl emprically, but quickly weaned to levaquin
alone for bronchitis, as no radiologic evidence of pneumonia was
present.   Sputum culture oral flora, no legionella.  urine
legionella negative.  He was continued on his  home regimen of
inhalers.  His steroid regimen was increased to 60mg po qdaily,
with rapid improvement in his symptoms.  He was transferred to
the medical service on HD#2.  After discussion with the
pulmonary service, plan was made for rapid taper to treat
reactive airway disease / ILD (decrease dose by 20mg every 3d
until reaching dose of 20mg po qdaily), completing a 7d course
of levaquin, with pulmonary follow-up within 1-2 weeks to
discuss bronchoscopy to evaluate TBM/ILD as an outpatient.
.
# leukocytosis/bandemia/tachycardia/metabolic acidosis -
initially consistent with SIRS picture, however, resolved with
IVF, thus felt [**3-12**] viral gastroenteritis as below.  Stool
cultures unremarkable at time of discharge.
.
# hyperglycemia/diabetes - steroid related per patient.  pt
continued on his home regimen of metformin.
.
# viral gastroenteritis - diarrhea/nausea/vomiting - consistent
with viral gastroenteritis.  symptoms resolved upon arrival to
medical service.  Stool studies negative for routine culture and
c. diff x 1.
.
# asthma - respiratory distress as above.  He was discharged on
his usual regimen of inhalers, and prednisone 60mg po qdaily
with plan for taper by 20mg po qdaily every 3 days.
.
# GERD. - continued home PPI and ranitidine.

IMAGING:
EKG: [**1-12**]
Sinus arrhythmia. P-R interval prolongation. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2122-12-17**] the rate is slower. The P-R interval is longer.
Repolarization
pattern is unchanged.
.
[**1-12**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of cerebral edema. If there is concern for
central pontine
myelinolysis, MRI is recommended for increased sensitivity.
2. Stable sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and
global
atrophy.
3. No mass effect or evidence of herniation.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Osmotic demyelination syndrome
(""central and extra-pontine myelinolysis"") generally occurs as
complication of the
treatment, with too-rapid correction, of patients with profound,

life-threatening hyponatremia, rather than the hyponatremia, per
se
.
[**1-13**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Borderline P-R interval prolongation. Q-T interval
prolongation. Early R wave progression. J point and ST segment
elevation are more apparent in limb and precordial leads. The
QRS width is also wider. Consider metabolic derangements.
Clinical correlation is suggested
.
CXR [**1-13**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-16**]:
Antilordotic positioning probably explains mild enlargement of
both hila.
Lateral aspect right hemithorax is excluded from the
examination. Remainder of the imaged lungs and pleural surfaces
are normal aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis. Heart is not
enlarged.
.
[**1-14**] Knee xray:
FINDINGS: There are severe degenerative changes involving the
patellofemoral compartment with bone-on-bone contact to the
patella with the trochlea at the lateral aspect. Bony
irregularity and erosion is seen. There is also faint
chondrocalcinosis. These overall findings can be seen in the
setting of CPPD arthropathy. There is a knee joint effusion.

Endoscopy ([**1-18**]):
colonscopy

Findings:	
Mucosa:	Mild and patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum
were noted. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
Protruding Lesions: A single sessile 4 mm polyp of benign
appearance was found in the hepatic flexure. A single-piece
polypectomy was performed using a cold forceps. The polyp was
completely removed.
Excavated Lesions: Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid
[**Month/Year (2) 499**]. Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Other: The exam of terminal ileum was normal. Otherwise the exam
of the rest of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] was normal. Cold forceps biopsies were
performed to rule out microscopic colitis.
Impression:	
The exam of terminal ileum was normal.
-A 4 mm polyp in the hepatic flexure (polypectomy)
-Mild patchy erythema at sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**] and rectum in the [**Month/Year (2) 499**]
(biopsy)
-Moderate diverticulosis of the sigmoid [**Month/Year (2) 499**].
-Otherwise the exam of the rest of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] was normal. Cold
forceps biopsies were performed to rule out microscopic colitis.

-Otherwise normal [**Month/Year (2) 2792**] to cecum and terminal ileum.
.
EGD/EUS
Findings:
Esophagus: Z line was regular. A 1 cm sliding hiatal hernia was
seen. otherwise the exam of the esophagus was normal.
Stomach: The exam of the stomach was normal. Cold forceps
biopsies were performed for histology.
Duodenum: The mucosa at the proximal bulb of duodenum appeared
mildly nodular. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology. The exam of the second part of the duodenum was
normal. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.
Other findings:	EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope
at 7.5 MHz frequency. The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged
from the duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body
and tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body and
fundus. A 0.8 cm X 0.6 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent
with a cyst was noted in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
The walls of the cysts were thin and well-defined. No intrinsic
mass, septations or debris were noted within the cyst. The cyst
did not appear to communicate with the main pancreatic duct. FNA
was not performed because of the use of anticoagulant and no
''alarm features''.  Pancreas parenchyma: there were mild
lobularity and hyperechoic strands throughout. But there was no
other chronic pancreatitis changes. Pancreas duct: The pancreas
duct measured 1.8-2 mm in maximum diameter in the head and neck
of the pancreas and 1.5 mm in maximum diameter in the body of
the pancreas. The walls of the duct were hyperchoic. No stone or
dilated side branch was seen. The exam of CBD was normal. It
measured 4 mm. The celiac take-off was normal. The portal
confluence was normal. The left lobe of liver was normal.
.
Impression:	
-Hiatal hernia
-EGD exam revealed a normal stomach and D2 (biopsy) and slightly
nodular duodenal bulb (biopsy) The
-Linear EUS evaluation was then performed
-A 0.8 cm X 0.6 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a
cyst was noted in the uncinate process of the pancreas. The
walls of the cysts were thin and well-defined. No intrinsic
mass, septations or debris were noted within the cyst. The cyst
did not appear to communicate with the main pancreatic duct. FNA
was not performed because of the patient's anticoagulated
status.
-Pancreas parenchyma: there was mild lobularity and hyperechoic
strands throughout. But there were no other findings of chronic
pancreatitis. These findings are compatible with, but not
diagnostic of, early chronic pancreatitis.
-Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 1.8-2 mm in maximum
diameter in the head and neck of the pancreas and 1.5 mm in
maximum diameter in the body of the pancreas. The walls of the
duct were hyperchoic. No stone or dilated side branch was seen.
-The exam of CBD was normal. It measured 6 mm, compatible with
post-cholecystectomy dilation
-The celiac take-off was normal. The portal confluence was
normal. The left lobe of liver was normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo woman with history of breast ca, HTN, cystocele and
hyponatremia, presented with recurrent hyponatremia and ARF,
found to have ETOH withdrawal.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hyponatremia: Patient has had previous admissions for
hyponatremia (and chronic hyponatremia with Na in mid-120s),
which was thought to be SIADH in setting of vasopressin
administration. Current presentation most likely a
multifactorial process, from low solute intake, possible excess
free water at home, diarrhea, as well as beer ingestion. Per
report, patient had some somnolence in the ICU but was easily
arousable to voice, which was thought to be most likely
secondary to the IV ativan she received prior to transport up to
the ICU. CXR negative for acute process and head CT was also
negative. Nephrology was consulted to help with management of
hyponatremia. Nephrology felt that presentation was consistent
with a combination of low solute intake, SIADH and perhaps
excess free water at home. In addition, pt also presented with
an osmolar gap suggestive of ETOH ingestion. Recent TSH was
normal, am cortisol 7 prior to [**Month/Year (2) **], not suggestive of
adrenal insufficiency.  Repeat AM cortisol was 11.7.  Her sodium
levels were followed closely as well as her blood and urine
osmolarity. Pt was encouarged to have a liberal salt diet,
1200ml fluid restriction, Ensure TID and was started on salt
tabs 1gm [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-14**]. Pt's sodium was monitored closely to ensure
that she did not correct too quickly.  Sodium level on day of
discharge was 133.  She will have her lytes repeated in
approximately 10 days time, on [**1-28**].  A prescription for a lab
check was provided to the patient and the results will be
forwarded to her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also see her nephrologist in
follow-up in [**Hospital 2793**] Clinic.
.
# L.knee pain-DDX included severe osteoarthritis vs. pseudogout
vs. gout. Pt did have a mechanical fall preceding [**Hospital **] but
did not have any previous knee pain. No new apparent trauma. No
new erythema or induration or warmth to suggestion infection or
septic joint. Xray confirmed severe arthritis with evidence to
suggest CPPD. Pt was given tylenol and a lidocaine patch for
pain. Uric acid was 3.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Peaked T's on initial EKG. She was given 1g
calcium, insulin and dextrose in ED. K+ 6.0 to 5.2. Baseline is
around 5.0. Was given kayexylate in ICU. Likely due to volume
contraction in the setting of ACE-i use.  Potassium levels were
monitored and remained normal.
.
#ARF: Presented with a creatinine of 1.2 from 0.7, although pt
stated she was drinking a lot of water at home, presentation was
still likely c/w pre-renal, given recent diarrhea. FENA
initially was 0.8%, FENA 0.9% 2/8. ACE-i and Celebrex were held
and can re-started in the outpatient setting after repeat Cr
check.  Creatinine on discharge was 0.7.
.
# Diarrhea/fecal incontinence/abdominal pain-pt with h/o IBS-
was recently supposed to have [**Hospital 2792**], endoscopy, and EUS to
further evaluate these complaints. Per report lipase elevated in
the past and that is why EUS was scheduled. The GI team was
contact[**Name (NI) **] during [**Name (NI) **] as it was felt that the patient would
certainly need inpatient prep given profound hyponatremia and
risk for recurrent profound hyponatremia. The pt was prepped and
underwent a C-scope, EGD/EUS on [**1-18**], and tolerated the
procedure well.  C-scope showed a 4mm poly (removed via
polypectomy), patchy erythema (biopsied), moderate
diverticulosis, and random biopsies of [**Month/Year (2) 499**] were also taken to
rule out microscopic colitis.  All the biopsies are currently
pending.  The EGD/EUS revealed a hiatal hernia, nodular duodenal
bulb (biopsied), pancreatic changes consistent with chronic
pancreatitis, and also a discrete lesion in the pancreas
measuring less than 1 x 1cm in size, consistent with cyst.  Pt
will need to have her biopsy results followed-up on, and per GI
recommendations, she will need a MRCP in 3 months time to
evaluate her pancreas again.  Given recent EtOH use, would
recommend waiting 3 months, but sooner if she develops weight
loss.  The cyst could not be biopsied as the patient is on
anticoagulation for her PE with fondaparanaux.
.
# Hx PE / DVT: Pt was continued on 7.5 fondaparanaux sc qd. She
remained on room air.
.
#ETOH use/abuse-Pt's daugther raised concern of drinking at
home. No reports of prior withdrawals. Pt appeared upset when
asked to give specifics on her intake. She was tangential on
answering the questions as well. Pt developed signs of ETOH
withdrawal upon transfer out of ICU to the medical floor was was
placed on a CIWA scale and given PRN valium. She was given MVI,
thiamine and folate and SW was consulted.
.
UTI - pt complained of dysuria.  Urine culture grew
Cipro-sensitive E. coli. Pt to complete a course of Cipro.
However, Urine culture also still growing 2nd organism, although
at lower colony count, only 10 - 10,000 CFU of GPC.  Will f/u
final culture data/results and will contact pt if antibiotic
regimen will need adjustment.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
#normocytic anemia-baseline appears to be between 21-40.
Presented at 32.
.
#GERD-continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI
.
#asthma-no sign of acute flare, continued fluticasone
.
#h.o breast ca-outpt f/u and monitoring.
.
#HTN, benign-did not appear to be on any meds at baseline
.
#gout-allopurinol
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
GI - will need outpatient MRCP in 3 months or sooner if weight
loss occurs.  Pt is already has order placed by ERCP but will
need to call to schedule actual MRCP appointment.  GI will need
to follow-up biopsy results.
Renal - pt will have to continue on fluid restriction, salt
tabs, and will need her lytes checked in 10 days, with results
to be faxed to and followed by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] see Renal in follow-up
as well.  Should continue to hold her Celebrex and lisinopril
given recent [**Last Name (un) **] until follow-up with PCP or Renal.
EtOH use/withdrawl - should continue on MVI/thiamine/folate.
Can follow-up with PCP to discuss treatment options.
.
UTI - currently growing Cipro sensitive E. Coli.  Patient to
complete course of ciprofloxacin.  However, 2nd bacteria also
growing, albeit only at 10 - 10,000 CFU of GPC.  Will f/u result
and call pt if she needs additional or changed antibiotic.

Mental Status: Clear and coherent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of hyponatremia
(low blood sodium), elevated potassium and impairment in your
kidney function. You were initially monitored in the ICU and
your symptoms improved. You were also followed by the kidney
team to help with monitoring of your sodium levels.  You will
need to continue taking salt tabs and restricting your fluid
intake.  You will need repeat labs done in approximately 1 week
(you can have them checked the day you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**1-28**]).
.
You underwent an endoscopy, [**Month/Year (2) 2792**] and EUS (endoscopic
ultrasound), which showed a polyp in your [**Month/Year (2) 499**], some areas of
inflammation (biopsied), diverticulosis, a hiatal hernia, a
nodular stomach (biopsied), possible chronic pancreatitis, and a
pancreatic cyst.  For your pancreatic cyst and possible changes
c/w chronic pancreatitis, you will need follow-up imaging with a
MRI in approximately 3 months.  This has already been ordered by
the GI doctors, and you will need to call after discharge to
schedule the exact date.  The contact number is listed below.
Your polyp could not be removed, as you are on a blood thinner.
This will need to be addressed by your PCP/GI doctors with
repeat [**Name5 (PTitle) 2792**] when you are off your blood thinning
medication.  Please call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2795**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2796**] office to get the

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**]
Chief Complaint:
GERD and small hiatal hernia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-6-12**]
Laparoscopic converted to open, redo Nissen
fundoplication, and repair of hiatal hernia.
[**2124-6-16**]

2. Endoscopy
[**2124-6-27**]

[**2124-6-27**]
CT guided drain placed in perisplenic fluid collection


History of Present Illness:
41-year-old black gentleman status post Nissen
fundoplication five years ago.  He did great during this time
with no reflux or difficulty swallowing at all.  He had
previously undergone endoscopic approaches to relieve his
heartburn, which had failed.  However, for the last two months,
he has had difficulty with some reflux as well as swallowing
water.  Endoscopy revealed a small hiatal hernia and gastritis.
A barium swallow showed a small herniation of the GE junction
possibly above the diaphragm.  He complains of these problems
with swallowing and also notes more frequent burping.


Past Medical History:
Episcleritis bilaterally: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
GERD s/p Nissen Fundoplication
Obesity
Hypercholesterolemia: Borderline in the past.
Chronically elevated liver function tests: Normal evaluation in
the past.
Chronic low back pain
Hypertension.
s/p distal biceps tear and repair on [**2119-9-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2719**].

Social History:
The patient states that he drinks beer occasionally on the
weekends. He smokes occasional cigars, but is exposed to
secondhand smoke at home. The patient smoked while he was in
military but quit over 10 years ago.


Family History:
Mother has a history of migraine headaches. His mother has a
history of diabetes. Uncle has a history of lung cancer. He has
four children who are all healthy.


Physical Exam:
Vital signs

Temperature of 97.2, blood pressure 143/92, O2 sat 99%, pulse
84, Resp 20, weight 236 pounds.
Breathing comfortably.
Abdomen is soft.  Incision is well healed.
Moving all extremities well.


Pertinent Results:
[**2124-6-14**]  UGI : No evidence of leak. Slow passage of contrast
from the esophagus into the stomach, likely from edema, with
residual barium within the distal esophagus.

[**2124-6-16**] CT Abd/pelvis/CTA chest :
1. Dense right lower lobe consolidation consistent with
pneumonia. Large
left pleural effusion with pleural enhancement; infection cannot
be excluded.  Small right effusion. Patchy consolidation at lung
apices suggests aspiration or infection.
2. Fluid collection in the surgical bed, extending along the
stomach and
pancreatic tail, with marked stranding in left upper quadrant.
Extraluminal hyperdense material at the GE junction may
represent surgical pledgets or extravasated contrast. Cannot
exclude anastomotic leak. Notably, however, there is no
intraperitoneal free air (endoscopy with insufflation was
performed prior to this examination to assess for leak).
3. Limited evaluation for pulmonary embolus due to timing of
contrast, but no evidence of large pulmonary embolus.
4. Peripancreatic fluid may be tracking from surgical bed, but
recommend
obtaining pancreatic enzymes for clinical correlation to exclude
pancreatitis as a cause of left upper quadrant inflammatory
change.
5. ETT terminates 1.4 cm above the carina. Consider
repositioning.
[**2124-6-17**] TTE :
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic
function. Right ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, mild
hypokinesis, and severe estimated pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. These findings are consistent with a primary
chronic pulmonary process.

[**2124-6-17**] Esophagus :
 No evidence of leak at the gastric fundus to correlate with the
findings on previous CT. While it remains possible that the
density at the GE junction seen on the previous CT represents
leaked barium, given the inability to demonstrate leak on the
present examination, these densities are felt more likely to
represent hyperdense pledgets which were reportedly used in the
surgery.

[**2124-6-19**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Stable size and configuration of
peri-GE junction low-density fluid. No new intraabdominal
collection. Unchanged extraluminal hyperdense material, may
represent extraluminal contrast versus surgical pledgets.
2. New small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the mid
abdomen (2, 66), most likely due to adhesion.
3. Improved bilateral pleural effusions status post left chest
tube
placement. Improved but persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Trace pneumomediastinum, likely expected post-surgical
change.

[**2124-6-26**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Interval placement of multiple
intra-abdominal drains, with persistent multiple low-density
collections within the lesser sac and peripancreatic location,
gastrohepatic space, and perisplenic regions. Though one of the
drains situated in the gastrohepatic space appears centered
within a fluid collection, the remainder of the drains do not.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion, larger in size, that is
slightly
hyperattenuating, may contain hemorrhagic or proteinacious
components.
3. Left subclavian line tip not central in location and should
be adjusted.
4. Trace free fluid in the pelvis, nonspecific, and may reflect
sequela of
recent surgery.

[**2124-7-2**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Interval decrease in size of
perisplenic fluid collection which contains a pigtail catheter;
decreased although persistent smaller loculations including
lesser sac, peripancreatic and gastrohepatic collection.
2. Near-resolution of a left pleural effusion which contains a
pigtail
catheter.
3. Stranding and low density within the abdominal wall
musculature,
developing collection not entirely excluded. Correlation with
physical
examination and consideration of ultrasound is suggested if an
infection is suspected in the area. The CT findings are
non-specific and may be
post-operative or due to serous or infected fluid.
4. Few subtle wedge-shaped hypodensities within the renal
parenchyma. main
differential considerations include infarction versus infection,
other
etiologies are considered less likely. Correlation with
urinalysis and other clinical factors is suggested. The areas of
relative hypoperfusion are in the upper poles only, so possibly
the appearance is secondary to nearby peripancreatic
inflammation and might not be significant in itself.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-6-12**] for a laparoscopic Redo
Nissen which was converted to open Nissen redo and hiatal hernia
repair. Postoperatively, he was transferred from the PACU to the
floor where over the next few days experienced an increase in
oxygen requirements with saturations in the 90s% despite
vigorous pulmonary toilet. His chest xray revealed a new large
left pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion.  This
prompted an upper GI which ruled out a leak. His pain was
controlled with an epidural and PCA and his stomach remained
decompressed with a nasogastric tube.

On [**2124-6-16**] he was transferred to the SICU as he had more
respiratory distress and was electively intubated for airway
control and subsequent imaging. He had a CT scan of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis. This imaging study showed a large left
pleural effusion and RLL consolidation c/w pneumonia, peri-GE
junction fluid. His WBC 25K at that time and vancomycin was
started. The thoracic surgery service was consulted for left
chest tube placement and subsequent endoscopy which revealed
normal mucosa, an intact wrap and no leaks. His chest tube
drained about 850 cc and his PO2 gradually improved. His sputum
culture was MSSA positive, BAL were both negative.  He also
developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was seen by the
Cardiology service. Part of their work up included an ECHO which
showed moderate-severe RV dysfunction demonstrated by PASP 62.
His EF was 60%.  his atrial fibrillation converted to NSR with
amiodarone.

On [**6-18**], he was trialed for extubation, but reintubated for
increased work of breathing.

On [**6-19**] he had a follow up CT scan which showed fluid at GE
junction. Due to an increasing WBC and no significant
improvement he had an exploratory lap and washout of
intraperitoneal hematoma which showed no evidence of leak. He
was started Zosyn and continued on vancomycin empirically. His
left chest tube was removed without difficulty.

From [**Date range (1) 2720**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to be intubated with a mucus
plug removed by bronchoscopy on [**6-21**], and a failed trial of
extubation on [**6-25**]. He had a follow up CT torso on [**6-26**] which a
large L pleural effusion and subdiaphragmatic/perisplenic
collection. Both the left pleural effusion and perisplenic
abscess were drained by IR on [**6-27**] with pig tail catheters.
These collections both drained dark fluid which were culture
negative. Mr. [**Known lastname 2721**] WBC count began trending down from 17 to 12
following drainage.

Additionally, after the IR guided drainage of the left pleural
effusion and perisplenic fluid, Mr. [**Known lastname 2721**] respiratory status
improved and he was extubated on [**2124-6-28**]. After extubation, he
improved rapidly and on [**2124-6-29**] his tube feeds, nasogastric tube,
foley, and central venous line were all discontinued and his
diet was advanced to full liquids. He was transferred to the
floor on [**2124-6-30**].

On the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to improve dramatically while
his WBC decreased to 10.3.  He was seen by physical therapy for
deconditioning but after a few treatments he was up and walking
independently.  A followup CT scan on [**2124-7-2**] showed that the
left pleural effusion had mostly resolved and the perisplenic
collection had decreased to 13 mm. His drains were then
sequentially discontinued. On [**2124-7-7**] the last drain was removed,
his WBC was 6K and his antibiotics were discontinued.

His abdominal wound drained some serosanguinous fluid from the
lower 1/3rd and was partially opened on [**2124-7-5**].  There was no
cellulitis and the base of the wound was clean.  He underwent
[**Hospital1 **] dressing changes with saline moist to dry gauze. He did have
some minor skin tears which were treated with non adherent
dressings. His appetite was slowly improving and he was also
started on Ensure for supplementation.

After a long, protracted hospital course he was discharged to
home on [**2124-7-8**] and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP


History of Present Illness:
84M PMhx metastatic papillary thyroid CA (s/p resection,
radioactive iodine) c/b lung mets, found to have large cavitary
mass in RLL, recent admission with malignant effusion + for SCC
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna.  Prior
hospitalization was also notable for PET scan that revealed
widely metastatic disease.

He presents today from rehab with acute respiratory distress.
Pt is [**Name (NI) 595**] speaking so history was obtained from family.  At
baseline he is on 2L o2, yesterday he was doing well, but last
night he woke up in respiratory distress.  The rehab reported
that he was sating at 80% on a non-rebreather mask.  EMS was
called and he was transferred the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Prior to event,
pt denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting.  He has a
chronic cough secondary to his lung ca but the quality of the
cough did not change.  he is not experiencing any pain.

Of note, pt's recent PMH is notable for rapid progression of
metastatic lung SCC.  He started experiencing chronic cough and
hemoptysis in [**Month (only) 547**] and symptoms have progressed since.  In [**Month (only) 596**]
he was noted to have a large cavitary mass in RLL with satellite
nodules suggestive of primary lung Ca.

At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was admitted to osh with fever,
leukocytosis and cough and treated with ctx.  His  symptoms did
not improve.  At this time a CT showed cavitary lesion as above
and a new large r exudative pleural effusion.  Effusion
reaccumulated resulting in supplemental O2 requirement.  As such
a chest tube was placed and the cytology came back + for SCC.
He was started on vanc zosyn for obstructive pna and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Hospital course was notable for r/o PE,
attempted pleurx catheter placement on [**6-27**] that failed due to
loculated effusions not amenable to pleurx.  At this point a PET
scan was done that showed extensive metastatic dz.

In the ED, initial VS were: t 98.1 80 106/46 80s on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
was started on bipap 60 15/5 and his sats improved to 96%.  He
was noted to have bilaterally crackles throughout lung fields,
and a power picc was in place in right ac fossa.

CXR is consistent with prior xrays from earlier this month, but
RLL effusion appears to have expanded.  Labs were notable for
wbc of 38k with 94% N,  hct was 25 and platelets 504.  He was
given vanc and cefepine and transferred to the unit.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is somnolent, on bipap and sating in
the low 90s.  he is with his family and easily arousable.  He is
answering questions appropriately.  His family was concerned
that he has been over sedated since he last left [**Hospital1 18**].  The
report that he has been sleeping all day and are concerned that
he is receiving too much narcotics.  Apparently he was recently
started on a fentanyl patch 50mcg at rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (s/p
resection, radioactive iodine) complicated by lung metastases,
found to have large cavitary mass in RLL with recent admission
for malignant effusion positive for small cell lung cancer
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna that presents
with acute respiratory distress. His respiratory distress was
thought to be secondary to aforementioned metastatic disease. It
was discussed with family and patient that his disease was
terminal without many further options. He was stabilized on
biPAP. Goals of care discussion yielded to make the patient
comfort measures only. He expired at 11:55 AM on [**2118-7-11**] with
family at the bedside including his wife and son. [**Name (NI) 6**] autopsy was
declined. Given death was within 24 hours of admission, the
medical examiner was notified but declined the case for further
review. The etiology of death was respiratory distress from lung
cancer.

Studies:
Brain MRI w/w/o contrast [**4-12**] -
A large mass measuring 3.2-cm in greatest dimension is present
within the
left posterior parasagittal parietal lobe. The mass is complex
in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular
enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral
slow diffusion. Tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis,
although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous T2
hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates T2
isointensity. A complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although
the CT obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this
mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible
that the density may be diminished. Possibly, both may be the
case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. Abscess is considered
less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on
diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion.

2. Multifocal confluent and FLAIR hyperintensities are present
within the
periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted
diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the
sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

C/A/P CT [**4-12**] -
1. Left upper lobe soft tissue mass with coarse calcification,
associated
traction bronchiectasis, and calcified hilar nodes. Additionally
pleural
calcification can be seen in prior asbestos exposure. There is
underlying
emphysema. These findings are worrisome for malignancy, though
prior
granulomatous infection might also have this appearance.
Correlation with
further studies (e.g. PET-CT, and/or biopsy) is recommended.

2. There is no evidence of malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis.

Head Ct [**4-13**] -
1. Status post resection of a left parietal mass with expected
post-surgical sequelae including pneumocephalus as well as some
blood products within the surgical bed.
2. Layering pneumocephalus along the left frontal cerebral
hemisphere with adjacent mass effect.
3. Ventricles appear more prominent on today's study compared to
MRI of [**2103-4-12**], concerning for early ventriculomegaly.
Recommend followup CT to monitor.
4. Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensities, more prominent on the left versus the right are
relatively unchanged since MRI

Brain MRI [**4-14**] -
1. Status post resection of left parietooccipital mass with
blood products at the surgical site without definite residual
enhancement. Pneumocephalus is seen and expected post-surgical
changes seen at the surgical site.

2. Linear area of restricted diffusion, extending deeper from
the surgical site to the left periatrial region could represent
an area of ischemia adjacent to the surgical site. Clinical
correlation recommended.

3. Changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy. No other
enhancing
brain lesions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to Neurosurgery for workup of new Left parietal lesion.
 Coumadin and aspirin were held on admission.  MRI with and
without Gadolinium revealed only the one solitary left parietal
lesion and therefore the decision was made to resect the lesion.
 Steroids were held for the possiblity of lymphoma.  Concern for
metastatic prostate CA to the brain was low, however CT
chest/Abd/Pelvis was performed for oncological workup.
Chest/Abd/Pelv CT obtained on [**2103-4-12**] demonstrated a LUL mass
with calcifications and b/l hilar adenopathy.  On [**2103-4-13**],
patient underwent left-sided craniotomy and ressection of the
left parietal mass. He was extubated without incident and
transferred to SICU for management.  His ICU course was
uneventful.  His post-operative CT and MRI showed post operative
changes without evidence of new acute hemorrhage.  He was
trasnferred to the floor in stable condition.

During his course on the floor, patient had persistent
hypertension. He was started on amlodipine 5mg with minimal
response. Medicine was consulted for Hypertension management.
Additionally, Thoracic surgery and neuro oncology were consulted
regarding the LUL mass and brain mass, respectively.  He was
transfered to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management.  The remainder of his course was as follows:

# Left parietal mass/left upper lung mass/likely new cancer
diagnosis: Patient and wife aware that mass likely represents a
cancer, most likely metastatic lung cancer, though not certain
as pathology is pending at time of discharge.  Dexamethasone was
tapered off.  Keppra was started for seizure prophylaxis and
should be stopped 10 days following discharge.  Pathology of the
mass will be followed-up as an outpatient.  Patient should
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in neuro-oncology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
in thoracics, and medical oncology in the thoracic oncology
clinic.  He will also need a PET/CT scan as an outpatient for
further evaluation and staging of his disease.  Please see
discharge paperwork regarding the appointments that need to be
scheduled when he arrives at rehab.  Additionally, he will
require PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] on discharge from rehab.

# Hypertension: BP was elevated post-op (160 and higher) and
improved on amlodipine and tapering of the dexamethasone.  He
was also continued on his home regimen of metoprolol, prazosin,
and nitroglycerine patch.  BP was 110-130 on day of discharge.
If blood pressure drops further, decrease amlodipine to 2.5 mg
daily.

# Urinary incontinence/retension and E. coli urinary tract
infection: Patient has a history of urinary retension and
incontince and straight caths himself multiple times per day
(~[**4-27**]).  His urine culture grew >100K E. coli, pan-sensitive.
He also had an elevated WBC count.  He was started on
ceftriaxone on [**4-16**] and is being discharged on cefpodoxime.  He
should have a total 14 day course for complicated UTI and will
need 12 additional days on discharge.  Foley catheter was
removed and regular straight cathing Q3-4 hours per home regimen
was reinstated to reduce risk of reinfection and promote
ambulation.

# Atrial fibrillation: Stable.  Patient remained rate controlled
on home regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol.  Warfarin was
stopped due to craniotomy and can be restarted on [**2103-4-21**].  He
should have his INR checked on [**4-24**] and every other day until his
warfarin dose and INR are stabilized.  Goal INR is 2.0-3.0.

# Coronary artery disease: Stable.  Metoprolol and statin
continued.  Aspirin was held.  It should be restarted on
[**2103-4-21**].

# Obstructive sleep apnea - Patient was continued on CPAP per
home regimen.

# Prostate cancer - Patient was continued on bicalutamide.  He
also receives goserelin injections from his urologist.

# Glaucoma - Continued timolol and lantanoprost eye drops

# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen while on pain
medications that should be weaned off.
# Code: Full
# Communication: Patient, HCP [**Name (NI) 3516**] [**Name (NI) 5598**] (wife)
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5599**]

On day of discharge, patient is afebrile and vital signs are
stable.  He is tolerating an oral diet and ambulating with
assistance.  His wound is clean, dry and intact.  He has no
focal neurological deficits.

have a mass in your brain.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your neurosurgeon,
removed this mass and the pathology to determine exactly what it
is, is still pending, though it is most likely some form of
cancer.  You were also found to have a mass in the left upper
lobe of your lung.  We have scheduled some specialist follow-up
appointments for you and additional appointments still need to
be scheduled.  These appointments are important to make sure
that you receive prompt evaluation and treatment for your
condition.  Please be sure to make and go to all appointments.

The following changes were made to your medications:
START Keppra 500 mg twice a day (for seizure prophylaxis).  You
should stop this medication 10 days after you leave the
hospital.
START Cefpodoxime 200 mg every 12 hours (for urinary tract
infection) for 12 more days.
START Amlodipine 5 mg daily for blood pressure.  If your blood
pressure drops below 115 systolic, this medication can be
stopped.
START oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.  While
you take this medication, STOP ultram.  As your pain gets
better, you can stop the oxycodone and go back to ultram.
START colace, senna, and miralax as needed to prevent
constipation
STOP Skelaxin.  You seemed to do okay without this medication.
START heparin for clot prophylaxis until your INR is therapeutic
or you are moving enough at rehab to prevent clots.
You can RESTART your aspirin and warfarin on [**2103-4-21**].  Please
get your INR checked on the 4th day thereafter and at least
every other day until your INR and warfarin dose are stable.
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0.

Additional instructions from your neurosurgeons are below:
General Instructions

[**2176-11-17**] CT Abdomen: no fluid collections. b/l renal cysts, gb
distention,
wall thickening and stones are unchanged with pneumobilia seen,
likely secondary to instrumentation

[**2176-11-18**] TTE  (post op due to new onset a fib): There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with normal left ventricular
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. Mild
aortic insufficiency.

[**2176-11-18**] ECG: Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Consider left
ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing of [**2176-11-17**] atrial fibrillation is new.

[**2176-11-19**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia. P-R interval prolongation. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing sinus bradycardia is new.

[**2176-11-19**] CXR: Stable chest findings, bilateral basal atelectasis
and mild
blunting of pleural sinuses.

[**2176-11-20**] ECG:Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Left axis deviation. Poor R wave progression. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with lateral ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-11-19**] rapid atrial
fibrillation is new. Lateral ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
Poor R wave progression is new.

[**2176-11-21**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Left axis
deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. There is an abnormal
transition across the precordium most likely due to lead
placement with additional evidence of possible prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
associated ST-T wave changes, although ischemia or myocardial
infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the previous tracing
atrial fibrillation is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2176-11-17**] HD1 POD0: Patient admitted to surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He
was made NPO and given IVF. He was taken to the OR for a
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His surgery was relatively
uncomplicated with minimal blood loss, however the patient
developed afib with RVR to 180 after extubation. He was
initially given lopressor which improved his HR, and then was
started on a dilt drip as per the primary team. He was also
started on a nitro drip for HTN with good control over his BP.
He has hx of MI and CAD s/p stents in [**2165**] and is admitted to
the TSICU for ROMI and stabilization. He denied chest pain,
nausea, or SOB at that time.

[**2176-11-18**] HD2 POD1: A cariology consult was obtained. They stated
that the atrial fibrillation likely secodnary to operative
course and has now resolved. Pt has not had any recurrances of
atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter since being on telemetry.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and pt did not have any chest
pain.
Repeated short runs of SVT are likely the palpitatiosn the pt
has been having for years. It appears to be a short RP
tachycardia and possible etiologies include atrial tachycardia,
AVNRT, or circus movement tachycardia. These are not dangeours
arrhythmias and the pt has likely been having it for years as
his symptoms suggest. Cardiology recommended no anticoagulation
needed. Pt should be sent home with his beta blocker and his
[**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts monitor.  They continued to follow throughout the
hospital course. The patient was tranferred from the ICU to the
floor.  He was placed on telemetry.

[**2176-11-19**] HD3 POD2: 12 lead ECG's performed [**Hospital1 **]. Patient was
given a clear liquid diet.

[**2176-11-20**] HD4 POD3: Patient's diet was advanced to regular kosher
diet, which the patient tolerated well.

[**2176-11-21**] HD5 POD4: Patient was placed on a full bowel regiment.
A holter monited was placed on the patient per cardiology
recommendations. Lopressor, IV was used for rate control.

[**2176-11-22**] HD6 POD5: Patient had a small bowel movement with the
bowel regiment in place. Potassium was repleted. Labs were
monitored daily.

[**2176-11-23**] HD7 POD6: A 12 lead ECG was performed due to some
ectopy seen on telemetry. The patient had a large bowel
movement. Spoke to electrophysiology fellow who stated that
despite the ectopy, the patient may go home with the [**Doctor Last Name **] of
hearts monitor.

[**2176-11-24**] HD8 POD7: The [**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts monitor was placed on the
patient and he was given adequate instructions on its use as
well as relevant follow up.  The metoprolol controlled the
patients heart rate and he did not have any episodes of atrial
fibrillation since POD 1. Patient was discharged to home.

Chief Complaint:
hematuria, weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83-year old Russian-speaking male with a past
medical history of IDDM, asthma, AFib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG

in [**2105**], diabetic ulcers, chronic venous stasis dematitis/severe

lower extremity edema follwoed by vascular service presenting
with hematuria, shaking in his R arm and hypotension and
tachycarida noted in the ED. History was obtained from son and
wife, who speak English, and are patient's primary caretakers.
[**Name (NI) **] has been declining since around [**Month (only) 1096**]; used to be able to
walk around and now needs assistance to transfer from bed to
chair, and has been mostly wheelchair bound. Patient was last
admitted in [**1-30**] for cellulitis in setting of his chronic lower
extremity edema. At that time he was experiencing shakes at
home, high fevers and on admission was noted to have L lower
extremity erythema. He was treated with a course of IV abx at
home (including course of zosyn, ceftriaxone for E. coli
bacteremia). He also was referred to podiatry and conservative
measures such as wound care, leg elevation and ACE wraps have
been used by his wife in order to decrease his chance of
infection, however he still has significant lower extremity
edema bilaterally.
.
Yesterday, his wife noted that the patient was urinating more
and then had bright red urine. He had never had this before. He
had associated L sided abdominal pain. Today he had a scheduled
podiatry followup appointment for wound debridement. No
purulence or drainage was noted from ulcers. Developed shaking
chills after this appointment and presented to the ED for chills
and for hematuria as his primary complaints. No fevers,
diarrhea, chest pain. He has had a dry cough, but this is
chronic and has been getting better (per family, related to
difficulty swallowing bt this has improved). Has also been
constipatied and his wife (who is a nurse and his primary
caretaker) manually disimpacted him on Saturday.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.8 131 88/45 18 95% RA. He
triggered soon after arrival for systolic BP in 80s and HR in
130s, and responded immediately to fluids. Baseline BP per the
wife who records multiple times per day is 80s-100s systolic.
Recieved vancomycin and zosyn after obtaining blood and urine cx
for concern for PNA with retrocardiac opacity noted on CXR. He
was also noted to have hematuria, foley cathter was placed and
initially urine was red with clots, but then ran clear wtihout
irrigation. Noted to have Cr elevated from baseline at 2.2,
microcytic anemia and INR 1.6 (on coumadin for Afib). Also
notedt o have transaminitis (AST 314, ALT 322), however specimen
was hemolyzed. VS on transfer afebrile, HR 87, 112/59, 22 100%
on RA. EKG with bundle branch block (old) and afib.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**5-12**]:
Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion. Recommend repeat
radiograph
after diuresis to assess for resolution of retrocardiac
opacities which could represent LLL pneumonia.

Abdominal u/s [**5-12**]:
1. Main portal vein is patent.
2. Bilateral kidneys show evidence of thinning of the cortex.
3. Gallbladder wall thickening with mild gallbladder wall edema
likely
represents third spacing in setting of congestive cardiac
failure.
4. Small amount of ascites.
5. Splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo M with IDDM, asthma, AFib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG in
[**2105**], diabetic ulcers, chronic venous stasis dematitis/severe
lower extremity edema followed by vascular service p/w hematuria
x 2 days and chills, hypotension and tachycardia following a
podiatry appointment for wound debridement.

Chills, hypotension and tachycardia was due to probable UTI with
urine culture growth of E coli. He completed 7 total days of
appropriate antibiotic therapy. It seems as though his
hypotension was a baseline blood pressure (at home per wife SBP
80-100) and his tachycardia was the major issue. Due to a h/o
bradycardia his nodal agents had been held.  His toprol and
digoxin at low doses were restarted and his amiodarone 400mg po
daily was continued. His tachycardia resolved, his BP remained
80-100 systolic and was asymptomatic.

PERIPHERAL EDEMA, associated with ascites and pleural effusions:
all consistent with acute on chronic right sided heart failure.
he was restarted on his home dose of torsemide and diuresed
about net negative 2 liters the first day wtih clinical
improvement in volume status. It is possible he has a greater PO
fluid / salt intake at home or does not take his torsemide as
prescribed but he responded well to this dose. His I/O's were
even over the next 24 hours.  He will continue on this but
should be weighed daily at home and his torsemide should be
adjusted based on his edema, weight and BUN/Cr.

CKD 3: creatinine remained stable around at baseline through
diuresis.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: As above restarted on nodal agents with
good effect. Coumadin continued at 2.5mg po daily with
therapeutic INR.

DM1 uncontrolled with renal and PVD comps, chronic diabetic foot
ulcer. The patient continued on his insulin regimen and will
follow-up with podiatry for further care.

DECREASED MOBILITY: subacute decline in mobility, patient has
been walking much less with a walker at home per his wife, PT
evaluated the patient and recommended rehab, which he and his
wife refused (as she had a bad experience involving the
development of pressure sores in the past) and instead PT
recommended he stay for [**1-22**] inpt PT sessions then be discharged
home w/ PT and VNA.

Chief Complaint:
Difficulty urinating, urinary retension and edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization [**2122-9-14**]
Peripherally inserted central catheter insertion (PICC) [**2122-9-11**]

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old Russian-speaking man with diastolic heart
failure, CKD, DM on insulin, asthma, atrial fibrillation (on
Coumadin), CAD (s/p CABG), h/o colon cancer, newly diagnosed
breast cancer (s/p biopsy 2 weeks ago), presenting with
abdominal distention, decreased urine output for the past two
weeks with urinary retention for the past two days.

His wife noticed increasing edema and abdominal girth
approximately 1 month ago. He saw his outpatient cardiologist
who increased his Torsemide dose from 100 to 150 mg PO daily.
Approximately 2 weeks ago, his wife again noticed increasing
abdominal girth and firmness as well, associated with decreasing
urine output. His cardiologist again increased his Torsemide
dose to 200 mg PO daily on week ago. His edema and decreased
urine output continued to progress, and he began to develop
scrotal edema. Two days prior to admission he was prescribed
metolazone 5 mg to be taken prior to dosing Torsemide. However,
he did not receive this medication. At this point he had urinary
retention, and his wife brought him to the emergency department.
Review of his medications from OMR revealed that he had been
prescribed Tamsulosin for BPH but he was not taking this
medication.

In the ED, initial VS T 97.5 HR 62 BP 99/49 RR 20 SaO2 96% on
RA. His creatinine was 2.6 which was an increase above his
baseline of 1.5-2. A Foley was placed, >600 mL of urine was
drained. A CXR showed vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
effusions left>right. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with
ventricular rate of 63, RBBB, LAFB, unchanged from prior EKG.
Bedside US showed bilateral pleural effusions. Abdominal U/S
showed free fluid and no hydronephrosis, but scrotal fluid. He
was not given diuretics initially because of his elevated
creatinine.

During admission to medicine service, he was given furosemide 40
mg IV with good response. However, on the following day, he
failed to respond to furosedmie 40mg IV, so the dose was
repeated. The following day, he also received furosedmie 40 mg
IV BID. His fluid balance was even over these two days. The next
day, he was given furosemide 80mg IV in the AM, 2.5 mg
metolazone followed by furosemide 100mg IV in the late
afternoon. In the evening, he triggered for worsening shortness
of breath. He was given metolazone 5 mg with furosemide 140 mg
IV around 11pm. He was also given his nebulizers and one dose of
Solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation. His O2 sats remained
>95% on [**1-22**] L/min O2. His CXR at that time showed bilateral
plueral effusions and vascular congestion. His net fluid balance
was negative 200 cc that day. Of note he also had two episodes
of hypoglycemia to 40s overnight accompanied by tachypnea and
wheezing; his respiratory symptoms resolved with euglycemia. His
dose of insulin had been decreased earlier that day because of
decreasing PO intake. His symptoms and hypoglycemia resolved
with dextrose. His insulin was further decreased to NPH 10 units
QAM and 5 units QPM with sliding scale. In the morning, he again
triggered for RR >30 and cardiology was consulted. Patient was
transferred to cardiology service for further management.

ECG [**9-3**]:
Artifact is present. Atrial fibrillation with a controlled
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block with left anterior fascicular block. There are small R
waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2122-5-13**] there is no significant change.

CXR [**9-3**]:
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart
size is moderately enlarged but appears similar compared to the
prior study. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with
perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness as well as
moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions. Patchy
opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive
atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute
osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with small
right, and moderate-sized left, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.

Renal Ultrasound [**9-4**]:
The right kidney measured 10.5 cm. The left kidney measured 11.5
cm. Both kidneys show cortical thinning. No hydronephrosis,
stones or massesis are observed. The bladder is not distended
with indwelling catheter within it.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral renal cortex thinning. No signs of
hydronephrosis.

Echocardiogram [**9-4**]:
The left atrium and the right atrium are moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta and the aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe pulmonary artery
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2121-12-12**], the findings are similar (prior study image quality
was superior). These findings are suggestive of a chronic
pulmonary process, e.g., PPH, chronic pulmonary embolism, COPD,
OSA, etc.

Chest X-ray [**9-12**]:
Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by slight improvement in
degree of pulmonary edema and associated decrease in right
pleural effusion, now small in size. Bibasilar opacities appear
similar to the prior study as well as a moderate left pleural
effusion.

1. Hemodynamic catheterization revealed the presence of
pulmonary arterial hypertension in the setting of moderately
elevated left venticular filling pressures. Right ventricular
filling pressure was mildly elevated in the setting of severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2. Vasodilator test wtih inhaled nitric oxide revealed no
reversibility of the pulmonary hypertension.
3. Cardiac index was at the lower limit of normal.

Upper extremity U/S [**9-15**]:
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral subclavian veins
were performed; normal and symmetric flow was observed.
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of left internal jugular,
axillary, brachial, cephalic and basilic veins were performed.
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation.

Chest, abdominal and pelvic CT [**9-17**]:
CT OF THORAX:
Prior median sternotomy noted. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, slightly larger on the right side. There is
associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior
basal segments of both the right and left lower lobes. More
confluent airspace opacity is seen radiating from the hila to
involve the posterior and apical segments of the right upper
lobe. The right middle lobe remains well aerated. Findings are
most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is
also seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with
less severe pulmonary edema. Satisfactory position of the
right-sided PICC line with the tip terminating in the lower SVC.
Dense calcification of the left coronary artery are seen. There
are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes.
There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region
likely representing the primary tumor.
CT OF ABDOMEN:
Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average
Hounsfield value of 100. Causes of this appearance include
hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, Wilson's disease and, most
likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug therapy. No focal
liver lesions are identified. The gallbladder outlines normally.
The spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is
made of a 17-mm low-attenuation focus in the lower pole of
spleen, which is incompletely characterized, but most likely
represents a hemangioma. Both kidneys demonstrate cortical
thinning; however, no focal lesions are identified. Both adrenal
glands are normal in size and appearance. There are no
pathologically enlarged upper abdominal. Abdominal aorta
demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
normal in characters and caliber
CT OF PELVIS:
The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic
portion of the urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate
is normal in size and demonstrates coarse calcifications. Normal
appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no
significant perivenous hematoma following right heart
catheterization. There were no enlarged inguinal or pelvic
sidewall lymph nodes. Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm
low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the anterior
aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass
is seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56).
Several other sub centimeter low attenuation foci are seen
adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57). Findings are in keeping
with multiple pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms and could be
further evaluated with MRCP.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are seen involving
the thoracolumbar spine. A 3-mm sclerotic focus in the right
ilium has the appearance of a benign bone island.
IMPRESSION:
1. Splenomegaly with low-attenuation lesions, incompletely
characterized, but by demographics likely representing a
hemangioma.
2. Malposition of the urethral catheter as described.
3. High attenuation liver parenchyma likely secondary to
amiodarone therapy.
4. No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
5. Airspace opacities and pleural effussions most in keeping
with pulmonary edema.
6. Cystic pancreatic lesions requiring further evaluation with
MRCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo M with diastolic CHF and pulmonary arterial hypertension,
CKD, diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy, asthma, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG [**2115**], remote H/O colon
cancer, new breast cancer s/p biopsy 2 weeks ago, presenting
with volume overload from a combination of right sided CHF and
acute on chronic kidney injury who is no longer responding to IV
:asix and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for aggressive diuresis.

Patient was volume overloaded on admission, which was attributed
to his known left and right sided diastolic CHF (with moderate
RV hypokinesis). He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for Lasix gtt after
attempted diuresis with bolus doses of IV Lasix were
unsuccessful.  Repeat echo was similar to prior showing severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension and resulting right sided heart
failure, with EF >60%. Right heart catheterization with inhaled
vasodilator testing was performed which showed elevated
pulmonary pressures that were not responsive to either 100% FiO2
or inhaled nitric oxide (PA 89/19/42). Thus, it was felt he
would likely not benefit from PDE inhibitor therapy. Aggressive
diuresis was continued with improvement in his peripheral edema.
Course was further complicated by transient bradycardia which
resolved spontanously, acute on chronic renal failure and
anemia. Despite response to IV diuretics, the patient's
respiratory status continued to decline. CXR and CT scan of the
chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary effusions. He was started
on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and
cefepime to complete a 7 day course. Interventional pulmonary
was consulted for potential thoracentesis, however they were
unable to find a pocket suitable for drainage on two occasions
despite use of ultrasound guidance. The patient's O2 requirement
increased to 6 L/min via shovel mask with saturations in the mid
90s.

When it became clear the patient was not responding to maximal
medical therapy, a conversation about goals of care was
initiated with the family who ultimately decided to make him
comfort measures only. Diuretics were discontinued, and the
patient was given PO morphine, hyoscyamine for secretions and
PRN Ativan. The plan was to transfer the patient to a hospice
facility closer to his home. A few hours prior to the scheduled
transfer, the patient's respirations became more labored. The
patient was then noted by nursing to be unresponsive. His
physician were called to bedside. After a few agonal breaths and
a few faintly audible heart sounds, the patient was documented
to have undetectable carotid pulses, pupils dilated to 5 mm
bilateral and non-responsive to light, no apparent respirations
by visualization and auscultation, no audible heart sounds, and

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left craniotomy


History of Present Illness:
In brief, this is a 64 yo M with hx of melanoma s/p craniotomy
and resection of metastatic melanoma in brain. He was initially
admitted after found down on [**5-3**]. Had multiple intraparencymal
hematomas, SAH, SDH. Underwent resection of tumor and cyst
cavities on [**5-6**]. S/p craniotomy which was done on [**5-6**] he has
been aphasic and had ongoing myoclonic seizures. He was
monitored on EEG and last seizure was 3 days ago, thought to be
in setting of sepsis and lowered sz threshhold. He is currently
on max doses of dilantin and Keppra and being followed by neuro
for AED recommendations. He was transferred to MICU for
management of septic shock after blood cx grew enterobacter
cloacae (possibly spread from urine). He was on CTX but
currently on meropenem, afebrile, and no leukocytosis. He has a
PICC line in place for a 14-day course of meropenem. LP was done
in MICU and was normal. Throughout the MICU stay he has been
tachycardic with a fib and flutter intermittently on tele. On
[**5-15**] he was ruled out for PE with negative CTA and LENIs. He
responds to fluids and HR is currently in the 90s on PO
diltiazem and metoprolol. [**Name (NI) **] sister is his HCP and has
recently made him DNR/DNI, she would like to discuss goals of
care with the primary team. Neuro-oncology has been following
and he may require XRT but there has been some discussion of his
current poor performance status limiting gains of further
therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
64M with h/o lung cancer in [**2169**] s/p resection, melanoma of left
arm s/p excision in [**2167**], who presented with left temporal
hemorrhage, secondary to metastatic melanoma, s/p craniotomy
with gross resection of lesion.

He initially presented after being found down and was admitted
to the ICU on neurosurgery service.  He underwent craintomy for
resection of his lesion and patholgoy returned as melanoma.

His hospital course was complicated by Afib with RVR and
ultimately rate controlled with oral diltizem and lopressor.  He
also developed enterobacter bacteremia and was treated for 14
days with meropenem.

Neuro-Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss the possibility of XRT
or other chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] however, the patient was too
agitated to tolerate mapping and sitting still long enough for
XRT.  Systemic chemotherapy was not considered given the
patient's many co-morbidities.  Several family meetings were
held to discuss his prognosis.  Initially the decision was made
to wait to see if his mental status improved, unfortunately it
did not.  Another family meeting was held and the decision was
made by his health care proxy to have him to go hospice and
focus on comfort.

He is being discharged to hospice.  All non-comfort related
medications were stopped prior to discharge. He should be
continued on pain medication, medication for atrial fibrillation
including aspirin, anti-seizure medication and GERD medication.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2183-10-23**]):    NO GROWTH.
ECG
Study Date of [**2183-10-22**]  9:36:34 AM
Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2183-10-19**] the rate is somewhat faster.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS US: Study Date of [**2183-10-20**] 1:34
PM No comparison is available. Bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins show normal
augmentation, compressibility and flow. Bilateral calf veins
show normal flow and compressibility. IMPRESSION: There is no
evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.

[**2183-10-15**] embolization:
IMPRESSION: Successful embolization of two right intercostal
arteries
supplying lung parenchyma.
Arteriography of the right subclavian artery and right imternal
mammary artery
showed predominantly pleural based hypervascularity, but no
significant
pulmonary parenchymal supply.

[**2183-10-17**] Bronch:
 This procedure was performed in
the intensive care unit.  This was under already obtained
consent of the ICU care.  The patient was correctly
identified in the intensive care unit.  He was sedated with
Versed, propofol, and some fentanyl.  Lidocaine was instilled
through the endotracheal tube.  Next, the currently present
#39 double-lumen endotracheal tube was unsecured from his
face.  The cuffs were deflated, and an 11-French Cook
catheter was threaded through the bronchial lumen into the
left main-stem, after which the tube was withdrawn, followed
by replacement with a single-lumen #8 endotracheal tube.  It
was secured at 24 cm at the lip.  The patient maintained
saturation at 100% during this portion.

Next, a flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the
single-lumen endotracheal tube and advanced forward, and as
we approached the carina, we noticed that there was
significant distortion from the previous operation.  There
was a very obtuse angle at the carinal bifurcation, and the
bronchus to the middle lobe was slit-like and had some
secretions, which were suctioned out.  Then, the right lower
lobe bronchus was examined.  There was some clot, which was
very carefully suctioned.  There was no evidence of active
bleeding.  After that, we performed aggressive suctioning of
the left main-stem as well as the left upper and left lower
lobes.  All the visible clot on the left side was removed.
At the end of the procedure, everything appeared very patent.
The patient was saturating above 95% during the entire
procedure.  Once we were satisfied with the result, the
bronchoscope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.
.
[**2183-10-22**]: MRI T spine:
The alignment of the thoracic spine is preserved. The vertebral
body height is preserved. There is no prevertebral soft tissue
edema. There
is no evidence of abnormal signal within the cord.

There is multilevel T2-hypointense signal in the intervertebral
disc
suggesting multilevel disc dehiscence seen in setting of
degenerative changes.
At multiple levels including T4-T5, T5-T6, T6-T7 and T7-T8,
there is minimal
disc bulging; however, there is no spinal canal or neural
foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal signal in the spinal cord.
2. Minimal multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic
spine, with no
evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
.
[**2183-10-21**]: FINDINGS: Right basilic PICC line is seen with its tip
in the distal superior vena cava. There are unchanged
postoperative changes in the right upper lung fields with volume
loss. Otherwise, there is no acute change in comparison to the
prior.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right basilic PICC line within the distal superior vena cava.

2. No additional acute changes compared to prior radiograph.
.
[**10-19**] RUQ US:
. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.

2. Small echogenic foci dependently within the gallbladder may
represent non-
shadowing stones versus small polyps.

3. GB adenomyomatosis.

4. Small hepatic hemangioma adjacent to the gallbladder fossa.



Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o with h/o NSCLC s/p chemo / XRT with resulting pulmonary
fibrosis and bronchiectasis presents with hemoptysis.

#Hemoptysis: On the day of admission ([**10-11**]) bronchoscopy
demonstrated a rapid bleed in the RLL, but they were unable to
visualize due to the briskness of bleeding.  He was intubated
and taken to to IR (details below).  This temporarily controlled
the bleeding, but Mr. [**Known lastname 5721**] has repeated episodes of
agitation and coughing which led to further episodes.  On [**10-13**]
he hemoptysized another 75cc and returned to IR for repeat
embolization.  He rebled on the evening of [**10-14**] and returned for
embolization on [**10-15**].  On [**10-17**], interventional pulmonology took
him to the OR and removed a large residual clot.  No further
bleeding was noted. While in MICU he was extubated on [**10-18**]. By
discharge he had no oxygen requirement.

IR:
[**10-11**]: R CFA access- R intercosto-bronchial art with late
communication w/pulm art noted- embolized with 300-500 um
embospheres; good angiographic result; no other ikely bleeding
source identified; hemostasis by manual compression.
[**10-12**]: R CFA site no hematoma, palpable distal pulses; no
apparent hemoptysis but Hct 48 --> 43 (0207) --> 36 ([**2198**])
[**10-13**]: recurrence of hemoptysis--> repeat bronchial arteriogram
and embolization(with 500-700 micron embospheres) of a large R
bronchial art; abnormal arterial blush was noted and there was
no spinal contribution; good angiographic result achieved; R CFA
access- hemostasis by digital compression.
#Sedation/withdrawal: During the initial week of hospitalization
Mr. [**Known lastname 5721**] required heavy sedation to remain comfortable while
intubated.  This included large doses of midazolam.  After
extubation he became autonomically unstable with tachycardia,
hypertension and tremors.  He was treated with q1h CIWA scales
and initially required frequent valium dosing. His agitation
eventually improved, and he became less tachycardic. His blood
pressure also improved.

#Neurological deficits. He was noted to have a left leg motor
deficit, as well as word finding difficulty. Neurology was
consulted and felt that he might have spinal cord ischemia
secondary to embolization. An MRI was ordered and showed no
ischemia of the spinal cord. Despite this finding they believe
transient ischemia is responsible for his improving deficits.
His word finding difficulty improved and he was able to speak
clearly prior to discharge.. His leg weakness improved as well
over the next several days. He passed speech and swallow and was
started on a diet. Diet on discharge: Regular Consistency: Soft
(dysphagia);  Thin liquids Supplement: Ensure breakfast, lunch,
dinner. Neurology recommends follow up in [**1-11**] weeks and repeat
MRI of T spine with diffusion weighting if deficits remain.
Despite LLE improvment he remains incontinent of stool and
retaining urine. Neurology also recommended wearing a soft
collar for arm tingling.

#Fever: Mr. [**Known lastname 5721**] had a fever on [**10-14**] and spiked again on
[**10-17**].  He was treated empirically for a ventilator-associated
pneumonia although no cultures were positive and there were no
suggestive findings on CXR.  He received an 8-day course of
vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Cultures were negative.

#Anemia: Some anemia, secondary to hemoptysis.  Received one
unit early in stay.  Hct was afterwards stable.

#Elevated Lipase - patient was noted to have a transaminitis as
well as elevated level of lipase. Most likely secondary to
propofol use for sedation; no evidence of biliary etiology.  He
did not complain of abdominal symtpoms. [**10-19**] RUQ US negative.
He has been eating without dificulty. Continued monitoring of
lipase and LFTS biweekly is warrented.

# Tachycardia: Multiple contributing factors, including resp
failure, anemia, and agitation. However with stabilization of
the above factors the patient remains tachycardic to the 110s to
120s. He was orthostatic but remains elevated despite fluid
resusitation. Benzo withdrawal was considered but thought
unlikely given the timeframe and administration of valium
without improvement. He is without onging oxygen requirement
making PE unlikely. Ongoing IVF resusitation is warrented. It is
also hypothesized that the tachycardia is from mild
pancreatitis. Ongoing heart rate monitoring is warrented.

# HTN: After extubation the patient was hypertensive with SBP up
to 190s. This was attribued to aggitation. He was treated with
IV metoprolol, clonidine patch, and IV hydral. With improvement
in his mental status BP improved and he was switch to
monotherapy with PO metoprolol by discharge.

# Delirium: Patient was aggitated for much of his ICU stay
requiring IV Valium, zydis, and IV haldol. This likely
contributed to hypertension and tachycardia. By discharge his MS
had returned to baseline without need for ongoing antipsycotics.

Delirium
Anemia


Discharge Condition:
good. A+Ox3, non ambulatory given LLE weakness. HR 110s


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you were coughing up blood. You
required a breathing tube to help you breath while you bleed.
You had three special procedures to help stop the bleeding. We
were able to stop the bleeding and remove the breathing tube.
After the procedure you had some difficulty moving the left leg
and with bathroom control. This is believed to be from
temporarily lack of blood flow to the spinal cord as a
consequence of the embolization procedures. You also remain with
an elevated heart rate which will continue to need treatment on
the rehab. You also had alterations in your mental status and
swallowing ability which have now improved.

The following changes were made to your medication list:
Lorazepam was discontinued
senna and colace were started
heparin sub cutaneous was started
metoprolol was started
testosterone is on hold.

stones. Apparently she was referred to a nephrologist at that
time and was told she had some evidence of kidney failure. She
was first told she may have kidney failure in [**2198-4-22**]. She was
seen by nephrology, but does not know any further details. She
has never been on dialysis before. She did not have this flank
pain at that time.

[**2199-3-18**]  URINE URINE CULTURE- < 10,000 organisms

Urine cytology ([**3-21**]) - pending

STUDIES:
CT abd/pelvis ([**3-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of diverticulosis or urinary tract calculi.
2. Unchanged large calcified fibroid uterus.
3. 2.9-cm low-attenuation left renal lesion larger than prior
study. Further evaluation with MR would be optimal. However,
given the patient's renal failure, US as an initial study is
recommended.

Head CT ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Sclerotic focus in the left humeral head, could reflect a
bone island given lack of underlying risk factors for
metastasis. Correlation with prior imaging to confirm stability
is recommended.

Renal US and doppler ([**3-19**]):
FINDINGS: There is a partly cystic/partly solid isoechoic mass
again seen in the mid portion of the left kidney which
corresponds with the recent CT
findings. This mass measures 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm and demonstrates
some
vascular flow within it on color Doppler imaging. The appearance
of this mass may be suggestive of cystic renal cell carcinoma.
No additional focal
abnormality is seen in the left kidney and there is no
hydronephrosis. The
left kidney measures 9.2 cm. The right kidney measures 10.0 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis and no stone or mass is seen in the
right kidney.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. Arterial waveforms of the main renal artery in the
right kidney
demonstrates a slight delay in upstrokes which may indicate some
renal artery stenosis. Sharp upstrokes are identified in the
arterial waveform of the renal artery in the left kidney.
Resistive indices of the intraparenchymal arteries on the right
kidney are slightly elevated ranging from .78-.80. The resistive
indices of the intraparenchymal arteries in the left kidney are
also slightly elevated ranging from .73-.83.

IMPRESSION: 1) Slight upstroke delay of the arterial waveforms
in the main
renal artery of the right kidney may indicate some renal artery
stenosis on the right side. Bilateral moderately elevated RI's.
2. Cystic and solid mass in the mid-left kidney, concerning for
neoplasm.

Bone Scan ([**3-21**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous
metastatic disease.

Renal Scan ([**3-26**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Reduced renal function bilaterally consistent with chronic
renal
impairment.
2. Differential renal function of 39% left kidney and 61% right
kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F with hypertensive urgency found to have a new renal
mass.

# Renal mass:  The patient was found to have a new renal mass on
the CT of her abdomen/pelvis done in the ED to evaluate her
flank pain.  On ultrasound the mass was seen to be approximately
2x2x3 cm and had both solid and cystic portions.  The size and
characteristics of the mass are concerning for renal cell
carcinoma.  Her renal mass was thought to account for her flank
pain.

On her admission CXR she was found to have a sclerotc focus in
her left humeral head which was concerning for metastesis.  This
was evaluated with a bone scan which showed no evidence of
metastesis.  Urology was consulted and felt that more
information was needed before a definitive plan for diagnosis
could be developed so a renal scan was preformed to assess the
functionality of her kidneys and showed differential renal
function of 39% from the left kidney and 61% from the right
kidney.

Because she currently has [**State 760**] Medicaid, we were unable to
schedule outpatient follow-ups for her with doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 764**].  Once she moved back to [**State 350**] she was
asked to contact Financial Services at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 765**] to apply
free care through this hospital.  However she was asked to
follow up with her PCP in NJ until this time and an appointment
was made for her with her NJ PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.
He was contact[**Name (NI) **] and asked to give her a referral to a
nephrologist and urologist in [**State 760**] until she moves her
care to [**State 350**].

# Hypertensive urgency: Her initial BP was 221/71 with worsening
of visual blurring and flank pain. No papilledema on exam.
Patient reports SBPs in 180s for several months and her PCP
notes confirm this.  She states she had been taking her blood
pressure medications regularly, however her PCP notes document
that she often runs out of her medicaitons and has difficulty
regularly taking her medications.  She was on maxed doses of
linsinopril and diovan as an outpatient and large doses of
atenolol.  In the ED she was placed on a labetalol gtt with
decrease in her SBPs.  Renal was consulted and recommended only
starting the lisinopril as it was unclear how compliant she had
been on her previous regimen.  As she remained hypertenisve on
lisinopril, long-acting dilitazem was added and uptitrated to
240 mg daily.  Atenolol was stopped given that it is renally
cleared and diovan was stopped.  She may continue to require
titration of her antihypertensive medications as an outpatient.

# Chronic renal failure: The patient had an admission creatinine
of 3.4. Patient had brought labs with her showing Cr 3.0-3.29 in
[**2198-12-23**]. FENA of 4.24 consistent with intrinsic or
postrenal etiology. This may be consistent with chronic diabetic
or hypertensive nephropathy. CT abdomen showed no stones, or
obvious obstruction. Renal was consulted and recommended
starting sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tid, vitamin D.  She was
given epo while hospitalized for anemia, however this was
stopped at discharge due to concern for insurance reimbursement.
 She was asked to follow up with a nephrologist for further
managment of her renal disease.

# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8. HCT of 31.1 on [**2199-1-20**]. Likely
anemia of chronic renal disease.  She had no evidence of
bleeding.  She was treated with epo per renal as above.  This
remained stable.

# MGUS: As part of the workup for her chronic renal
insufficiency UPEP and SPEP were sent which returned showing a
monoclonal IgG lambda protein spike.  Hematology/oncology were
consulted to ascertain the significance of this finding and they
felt this represented MGUS because the level of protein seen was
small.  There is concern that her kidney disease could be due to
amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease, however a kidney
biopsy would be necessary to diagnosis this and at this time
cannot be preformed given her renal failure.  She will need
yearly UPEP and SPEP to monitor for developement of multiple
myeloma.

# Type 2 Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.
 This was held while she was hospitalized and she was covered
with a sliding scale, monitored with qid fingersticks, and kept
on a diabetic diet.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary -
Renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma
Hypertensive urgency
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance
Chronic renal insufficency, Stage IV

Secondary -
Diabetes


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to elevated blood pressure
and back pain.  Your blood pressure was controlled with
medications.  Your scans showed a mass in your left kidney which
was concerning for cancer.  We were also concerned about a mass
seen on your left arm X-ray.  A bone scan done for this was
normal, which is good.

For the kidney mass, we contact[**Name (NI) **] the urologists, who specialize
in kidney surgery.  We did a special kidney scan to take a
closer look at the kidney mass.  You will need to see the
urologists (kidney surgeons) in follow-up after you get
discharged from the hospital.

While you were hospitalized you were also found to have abnormal
protein in your blood and urine.  The cancer specialists were
called and felt you have a disease called Monoclonal Gammopathy
of Unknown Significance (MGUS).  People with this condition have
a small chance of developing a cancer of the blood called
multiple myeloma and need to be screened yearly to check for
this.

Due to your chronic kidney failure you should avoid taking
antiinflammatory medications such as Motrin, Alleve, ibuprofen,
or naproxen.  For pain you can take Tylenol or ask your primary
care physician what to take.

Medication changes:
1.  You were started on diltiazem 240 mg by mouth daily.  You
should take this in addition to lisinopril 40 mg daily for
control of your blood pressure.  It is very important that you
take these medications regularly.
2.  Your diovan and atenolol were stopped.
3.  You were started on sodium bicarbonate 650 mg by mouth three
times daily due to your kidney disease.
4.  You were started on Vitamin D

Followup Instructions:
Because you currently have [**State 760**] Medicaid, we were unable
to schedule outpatient follow-up for you with doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 764**].  Once you have a place to live in [**State 350**],
you will need to contact Financial Services at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 765**] to
apply free care through this hospital.  However, until that is
arranged, you will need to continue seeing your doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
[**Name5 (PTitle) **].

An appointment was made for you to follow up with your primary
doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 760**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a blood pressure and blood
work check on Monday [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.  You will also need to
ask him for a referral to a kidney specialist (nephrologist) and
a kidney surgeon (urologist) in [**State 760**].

As you will be moving to [**State 350**] soon you can schedule an
appointment with a new primary doctor at [**Hospital6 **]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]) once the above are resolved.

It is important that you follow up with urology to discuss a

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Last Name (un) 159**] after undergoing laparoscopic
Right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The
patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition for
monitoring due to extensive comorbidities and not for any
intraoperative complication.  On POD0, pain was well controlled
on PCA, hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with
pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and
ambulated once. She was seen by the cardiology service and the
nephrology service and underwent HD while int he ICU.  On POD1,
the patient was restarted on home medications, basic metabolic
panel and complete blood count were checked, pain control was
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, Foley was removed
without difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. Prior to
discharge the patient underwent a CT scan with contrast of the
chest to evaluate pulmonary nodules seen on CXR.  She underwent
HD after this.  The remainder of the hospital course was
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in 3 weeks
and to also call for follow-up with nephrology and cardiology.

Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Intubation
Hemodialysis after HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage IV NSLC lung cancer
(EGFR wild type), DM2, HTN who presents with respiratory
distress.

Patient was with cough and not feeling well this AM. She went to
dialysis where she was coughing intensely to the point that the
needles came out of her AV graft. She appeared short of breath.
Unclear what EMS course was. Upon presentation to the ED, her
eyes were open but she was none verbal. Some history obtained by
cousin in [**Name (NI) **].

Of note, her lung cancer involves the right upper lobe mass and
adjacent hilar/mediastinal/supraclavicular nodes. Patient met
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **], who started vinorelbin for
palliative chemotherapy about 2 weeks ago.

In addition, patient's admit weight was 62 kg with an estimated
dry weight of 58 kg.

ED Course:
Initial VS at 11:40 on [**10-21**] were T 97.7 HR 100 BP 181/69 RR 32
Sat 84 %. She triggered for respiratory distress. Eyes were open
but non-verbal. There was a question about intubation/code
status. ED physician spoke to next of [**Doctor First Name **] (Mr.[**Last Name (Titles) 732**]). He stated
that she would want to be intubated. Intubated with 7.5 ETT with
ricironium 60 mg and etomidate 20 mg. Sedation with versed and
propofol. After intubation, VS were 95, 125/59, 25, 99% on vent

CXR revealed RUL opacity. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1
and levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 initially followed by addition of
vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 to cover HCAP. EKG showing Sinus Tach,
TWI V4-6, ? peaked T's.

.
On the floor, patient was sedation and tolerating ventilator
well. Renal was consulted for HD but noticed left graft not
functioning. Placed RIJ line for dialysis access. Dialysis was
going to be performed but hypotensive to MAPs ~ high 50s. CVP 4.
Propofol was switched to versed/fentanyl. Dialysis was not
performed. Patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with BAL
showing RL apical segmental occlusion (? tumor), 90 % anterior
segment occlusion, and patent posterior segment. Pressure
subsequently in 180s.

BRONCHIAL WASHING [**2200-10-21**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

ADMISSION EKG [**2200-10-21**]
Sinus tachycardia. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to
intraventricular conduction
delay, left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-7-29**]
sinus
tachycardia is now present and ST-T wave abnormalities are more
prominent.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-21**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple limitations as above. There is diffuse and
severe
pulmonary edema. A dense consolidation on the right may indicate
confluent
edema, although pneumonia or underlying mass lesion cannot be
excluded.

ECHO [**2200-10-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate to severe global
hypokinesis. Lateral wall function is relatively better. No
significant mitral regurgitation seen.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-24**]
There is now complete opacification of the right upper lung with
increase of
the right mediastinal shift. The findings are consistent with
interval
development of atelectasis but there is potentially some
additional cause that
precludes significant volume loss such as hemorrhage.
Correlation with
bronchoscopy is highly recommended. Position of tubes and lines
and the left
perihilar region opacities are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage
IV NSCLC involving RUL, DM2, HTN who presents with acute
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress and RUL opacification
secondary to possible post-obstructive pneumonia in addition to
initial neutropenia.
.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress
Ms. [**Known lastname 784**] was originally intubated and ventilated in the ICU
setting upon admission.  After initially failing pressure
support trial, she was ultimately able to be extubated on
[**2200-10-23**] after a discussion with the family concluded that if
Patient extubated initially failing trial of pressure support.
Cause of the respiratory distress thought to be likely
multifactorial with RUL opacification representing
post-obstructive pneumonia given bronchscopy and ? pulmonary
edema contribution although not clinically evident
(?lymphangitic spread of cancer).  Per goals of care
conversation with the family and HCP, the decision was made to
not reintubate, and ultimately, she was made CMO.  She was kept
comfortable with morphine concentrated oral solution and
scopolamine patch was used for secretion control.  She was
started on a morphine gtt with bolus morphine for breakthrough
[**12-24**] tachypnea on [**2200-10-27**]. The patient passed away on [**2200-10-27**].
.
# Sepsis secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia with subsequent
pan-sensitive E. Coli bacteremia. Patient with leukocytosis and
fever (100.7) during MICU stay.  She was originally treated with
vanc/levofloxacin however this was changed to Zosyn after cx
data returned.  Upon admission, she was neutropenic [**Last Name (un) 834**]
vinrelbin chemo 2 weeks PTA. This resolved over time.  The
source of her bacteremia was thought most likely [**12-24**] pulmonary
system.  After the decision was made to become CMO, antibiotics
were discontinued and she was kept comfortable with tylenol
liquid prn for fever.
.
# Non-gap mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
Metabolic acidosis resolved s/p dialysis. Continued to have
respiratory acidosis likely secondary to hypoventilation
post-extubation.  ABGs and blood draws to monitor lytes and K
were discontinued after the patient was made CMO.
.
# Hypotension: Patient had issues with pre-load dependent
hypotension during her MICU course. Patient appeared adequately
resuscitated and a recent ECHO showed moderate to severe
hypokinesis, which may represent myocardial depression [**12-24**] to
sepsis and acute illness vs. baseline heart disease.  After the
patient was made CMO, dialysis was discontinued and vital signs
were no longer taken.

# EKG changes: TWI different from prior on admission. In state
of acute illness, demand ischemia possible. EKG changes resolved
by morning. Troponins bland. Acute plaque rupture very unlikely.
Many of her cardiac medications were stopped during her MICU
stay, and were not restarted given her CMO status (ASA, plavix,
lipitor, heparin gtt, ACE/BB).
.
# Chronic kidney disease requiring HD.  HD was performed by
renal during her MICU stay.  Medications were renally dosed, and
nephrotoxins and IV contrast were avoided in the setting of CKD.
 HD was discontinued when the patient was made CMO.
.
# Stage IV NSCLC
- discussed with primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who thinks
chemotherapy unlikely to provide patient any benefit.
.
# Anemia
Baseline Hgb ~ 11. Current stable around ~ 8. No evidence of
acute blood loss.
This was trended, but after the patient was made CMO, no more
labs were checked.
.
# Chronic heart failure, systolic, EF 30 % with MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] does
not have active signs of heart failure although transient
diastolic function can cause pulmonary edema. ECHO showed
resolving MR.
.
# History of reactive airway disease: continued on ipratropium
nebs, until CMO status, at which point they were d/c'ed as
family felt pt did not derive help with them.
.
# Diabetes - pt did not receive oral hypoglycemics, but rather
was placed on a SSI until this was stopped when she was made
CMO.
.
# Goals of care
Multiple family meetings held (see ICU attending note for more
details). Per HCP, DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**] with no pressors. Given that her
health deteriorated during her MICU stay, the patient was made
CMO by the family including her HCP in light of the
post-obstructive pneumonia difficult to treat in the setting of
Stage IV NSCLC.  She was transferred to the medicine floor after
lines were d/c'ed.  All vital sign checks and lab draws were
discontinued, and the family remained at the bedside.  The
patient was prescribed only medications for comfort, which
included tylenol liquid, morphine sulfate concentrated oral
solution, ativan, and haldol.
.
Of note, SW saw the pt and provided counseling to the family
throughout her stay on [**Wardname 836**].

not seen an Oncologist in over a year (no shows to
appointments). She recently went to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6924**] of [**Hospital3 4262**] in
an attempt to re-unite with medical care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.4, HR 115, BP 117/95, RR 16.
O2 98%. EKG demonstrated electrical alternans and consequently a
bedside ECHO was done which demonstrated large effusion with
suggestion of tamponade. Patient was admitted to the CCU for
further monitoring.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative otherwise than noted in

Pertinent Results:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2116-9-12**]: Difficult study due to patient
frequent coughing. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is abnormal diastolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is a large pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.
.
CXR [**2116-9-12**]:
1. Bilateral effusions.
2. Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
3. Cephalization of the pulmonary vessels consistent with mild
congestive failure.

Pericardial fluid biopsy 10/10/9:
Positive for malignant cells.
Consistent with breast carcinoma.
.
10/10/9 Echo:
IMPRESSIOn: Large circumfirential pericardial effusion without
overt echocardiographic tamponade.
.
10/10/9 Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of
pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic
pressure
contours.
2. Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of
right
atrial and pericardial pressures.
3. After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial

pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures
remained
elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure
of
16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign,
consistent
with residual effusive-constrictive picture.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial effusive constrictive disease.
.
10/10/9 Echo:
Post-cardiocentesis echocardiogram performed in the cath lab.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a
residual pericardial effusion. There is no echocardiographic
evidence of tamponade.
Compared with prior from today, effusion size has significantly
decreased.
.
10/10/9 CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral effusions.
2. Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
3. Cephalization of the pulmonary vessels consistent with mild
congestive
failure.
.
10/11/9 echo:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-9-12**]
(post pericardiocentesis), no change.
.
10/10/9 EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-7-20**]
the rate has increased.
10/11/9 EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific diffuse ST-T wave changes are
suggestive
of pericarditis. Compared to previous tracing ST-T wave changes
are new.
.
[**9-16**] Pleural fluid analysis:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with adenocarcinoma.
.
[**9-16**] CT torso:
1. Large nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis. No pulmonary lesion, however evaluation limited by
atelectasis.
2. Pericardial drain in place.
3. Multiple new scattered sclerotic lesion throughout the
thoracolumbar spine
compatible with osseous metastases.
4. New 5-mm nodular soft tissue in the anterior mediastinum
since [**2111-12-29**]. Metastasis not excluded.
5. Left mastectomy.
.
Pathology - pleural biopsy & pericardium:
I. Pleural biopsy:
- Fragments of pleura and skeletal muscle.
- No malignancy identified.
II. Pericardium:
- Fragments of pericardium with chronic inflammation.
- No malignancy identified.
.
10/15/9 CXR:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
upright position and analysis is performed in direct comparison
with the next preceding similar study of [**2116-9-16**].
During the examination interval two chest tubes have been placed
in the left hemithorax pleural space. The caliber of the tubes
is moderate (5 mm) both tubes are entered the left lower chest
base laterally. One of these tubes meanders in cranial direction
and terminates in a loop shape in the upper lateral pleural
space overlying the anterior third rib frontal view. The second
tube is similar entrance type turns in caudal direction and
could possibly drain in the pericardial space.  Precise
location; however, require additional lateral view if so deemed
clinically important. The left apical area an approximately 1.5
cm wide pneumothorax is now seen. Otherwise, the lung appears
reasonably well aerated. No new parenchymal abnormalities are
present. The previously noted left lateral pleural effusion has
been practically eliminated.
IMPRESSION: Two chest tubes in place, small 1.5 cm apical
pneumothorax is
present. No new other abnormalities.
.
[**9-20**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Resolved left pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who
presents with 1 month history of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea;
1 week history of pleuritic chest pain and 1 day history of
bilateral lower extremity edema.
.
# Pericardial effusion: Explains patient's symptoms of DOE,
orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain and lower extremity edema. On
physical exam patient has distant heart sounds, increased JVP
suggestive of tamponade. Tamponade supported by findings of
electrical alternans on EKG. Patient currently tachycardiac with
stable blood pressure and no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
Unable to measure accurate pulsus paradoxus due to frequent
coughing, however most likely elevated. ECHO demonstrated large
pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Differential for pericardial effusion is broad including viral
pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune, hypothyroidism however based on
patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss
is very concerning for metastatic malignancy. Viral infection
possible with patient's history of sore throat and chills. Labs
do not demonstrate renal or liver disease. No prior history of
TB. Weight loss makes hypothyroidism less likely. No recent
rashes or joint pain to suggest autoimmune.
Patient went to the cath lab and had a pericardial drain placed.
Pericardial effusion was sent to pathology - found to be a
malignant effusion, with cells consistent with breast carcinoma.
Patient treated with indomethacin for her chest pain, as well as
opiates and anxiolytics as needed. Once the drainage from the
pericardial drain diminished, surgery created a pericardial
window during a L VATS procedure.
.
# Pleural effusion: Patient with bilateral pleural effusions.
Thoracentesis done in the CCU to drain the right pleural
effusion ([**9-16**]), with cytology & laboratory studies sent.
During surgery's pericardial window creation procedure, the left
pleural effusion was also drained and a talc pleuradesis was
performed. Patient had 2 chest tubes s/p surgery, and then those
were pulled by surgery prior to moving from the CCU to the
floor.
.
# Breast cancer: According to patient she is in remission.
However, patient has missed multiple appointments and did not
follow-up with her oncologist. Patient's last appointment
[**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin (aromotase
inhibitor) which she is currently not taking and is over due for
mammagram.
Patient found to have metastatic disease, with radiologic
evidence of metastases to the spine, and cytology in the
pericardial fluid. Hematology/oncology was consulted,
laboratory/imaging studies ordered for them, and outpatient
follow-up was set-up. Patient was given the diagnosis of
metastatic breast cancer during a family meeting, and patient
had multiple opportunities for discussion with the team of
physicians, after the diagnosis was given.
.
# CORONARIES: Postivie risk factors of HTN and smoking (smoking
cessation discussed). Pleuritic chest pain does not support
angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD. Once patient's
hypotension resolved (s/p drainage of pericardial fluid),
patient restarted on home lisinopril.
.
# PUMP: No history of congestive heart failure. See treatment of
tamponade above.
.
# RHYTHM: Sinus, on telemetry.
.
# Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam. CXR reports atelectasis
vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe. Patient treated
with albuterol NEBs, ipratropium NEBs, continued outpatient
singulair. Patient with cough during hospital course. Stable on
discharge.
.
# Depression: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
.
# Vaginal itching: concern for yeast infection, treated with
antifungal [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
.
# Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports
stresses at home (difficult family dynamics, including with
husband). Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not
show appointments).  Social Work consulted and followed closely,
including being present when diagnosis of metastatic disease was
given to patient. Patient received support from medical team on
multiple repeated occasions. Oncology aware. Patient very needy
during hospital course, and very upset with returning home.
.
# HbA1C pending on discharge.

.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4, HR 108, BP 107/60, RR 24,
Pox 100. Patient underwent CXR that revealed emphysema, stable
bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia. A CT head
was done prior to anticoagulation, as PE was high in the
differential, (given her history of metastatic breast CA) and it
revealed a new 7 mm mass possibly metastasis vs vascular lesion.
Due to this anticoagulation was not started. LENI's were found
to be (-). D-dimer was 655. She was given 2 L IVF, solumedrol
125 mg and benadryl 50 mg in preparation for possible contrast
study. A CTA with gadolinium was performed that revealed no
acute PE or aortic pathology.
.
On the floor, was found to be in stable condition.

.
Imaging:
CXR PA/L [**7-15**]: IMPRESSION: Emphysema, bilateral pleural
effusions appear stable. No evidence
of pneumonia or CHF.
.
CT-Head [**7-15**]: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. New 7 mm ovoid hyperdense focus in the right frontal lobe
without
surrounding edema. This is concerning for an underlying mass
such as
metastasis, or could conceivably represent a vascular lesion.
MRI is
recommended for further characterization.
.
LENI [**7-15**]: IMPRESSIONS: No DVT of either lower extremity.
.
CTA [**7-16**]:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolus. Small peripheral
emboli cannot be excluded given suboptimal contrast bolus and
motion artifact.
2. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the left.

. Partial atelectasis of left lower lobe and right middle lobe.
4. Increasing and enlarging sclerotic foci in the osseous
structures,
consistent with progressive metastatic breast cancer. No acute
fractures.
.
CXR Portable [**7-19**]:
FINDINGS: Following thoracentesis, there is no evidence of
pneumothorax.
Since the study of [**7-18**], there is little overall change in the
appearance of the bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectatic change. Central catheter remains in place.

MRI:IMPRESSION:
1. Innumerable T1-hypointense, FLAIR-hyperintense lesions
through the
cervical and thoracic spine, representing extensive osseous
metastatic
disease, with no evidence of pathologic fracture and no
associated epidural or paraspinal soft tissue mass. 2. Central
disc extrusion at C6-C7 with moderate spinal canal narrowing and
remodeling of the ventral spinal cord, with no intrinsic signal
abnormality and no evidence of exiting neural impingement.  3.
Bilateral pleural effusions, incompletely imaged.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress - patient initially presented with new
oxygen requirement, and was covered for COPD exacerbation but
then was found to have pleural effusion, that required drainage,
which improved her respiratory status. She still requires 3L.
.
# Pleural Effusions - patient was found to have large pleural
effusions, most likley secondary to metastatic disease. After
drainage a pleurex was placed and patient's respiratory status
improved. Pleurex is to be drained every two days and is to
remain in place permanently.

# Breast CA (brain met) - it was discovered that patient had new
brain mets on a CT scan. Follow up MRI of the spine also showed
spine mets (patient could not tolerate contrast because she
could not lie flat). An LP was performed, but did not reveal any
cells. Patient will require radiation treatment for the brain
and spine mets. She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] as well as
Rad-Onc team regarding treatment.

# Anxiety / Depression / Tachycardia - patient has been in
tachycardia throughout her stay here. Otherwise asymptomatic,
afebrile. We never found a cause for her tachycardia.

Follow up Instructions:
Patient needs follow up with neurooncology regarding irradiation
of brain metastases.
Patient should follow up with primary oncology regarding further
treatment of her cancer.
Patient will go home with Pleurex, and will need follow up
regarding changes in the amount of fluid being drained at
primary oncology [**Last Name (STitle) 4314**].
Please follow up on Blood pressure status, as patient had
episodes of hypotension that required boluses to keep her BP up.
She was asymptomatic during these events.
Please let the patient know when the Neuro-onc appointment is
when she is in clinic on [**8-6**]. As of discharge, there
was no appointment in the system.
She will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] on [**8-23**] for follow up.
-Please remove sutures from the catheter on [**8-6**].

For gross examination only.
Left hip, granulation tissue, excision (A):
Coagulative necrosis and macrophage reaction to particles,
consistent with wear debris.
Left acetabulum osteolysis, excision (B-C):
- Granulation tissue, coagulative necrosis and macrophage
reaction to particles (consistent with wear debris).
- Degenerative bone.
.
HIP [**4-3**]-OUR VIEWS OF THE LEFT HIP:

Left total hip arthroplasty has been removed and there is
significant
osteolysis of the acetabulum and proximal femur with proximal
migration of the
femoral shaft. Infection cannot be excluded. Hemi-osteotomy is
noted
extending from the subtrochanteric region to the lateral cortex
of the
proximal femoral diaphysis secured by four cerclage wires. There
are
overlying surgical staples, soft tissue swelling and
subcutaneous emphysema.
Prostatic seeds are noted. There is an ostomy in the right lower
quadrant.

It is noted that cultures were obtained at the time of surgery.
.
CXR [**4-3**]-IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumothorax after central venous catheter
placement.
2. Persistent right apical thickening, probably due to scarring,
but in the absence of a more remote comparison, this could
represent a small right apical lung cancer, which should be
evaluated with chest CT.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
CT Pelvis [**4-6**]-IMPRESSION:
1. Status post removal of left total hip arthroplasty, resulting
in
Girdlestone configuration, with superior position of the left
femur and
mutiple femoral cerclage wires.
2. Nondisplaced linear lucency within the proximal femoral shaft
new since the radiograph of [**2201-2-16**] -- ? osteotomy.
3. Marked acetabular protrusio configuration. The inner surface
of the left acetabulum is markedly thinned and, in areas,
effaced. Focal osteopenia also noted in lesser tuberosity.
4. Apparent large fluid collection within and around the
""joint"", which may represent a post-operative seroma.A few small
locules of air noted, which could relate to recent surgery.
Please note that the presence or absence of infection cannot be
determined based on imaging. Drains present.
.
Head CT [**4-9**]-IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Scattered
hypodense
areas in the white matter as described above, which are likely
similar to the prior MR head study of [**2199-1-2**]. If there is
continued clinical concern for abnormality, MR head can be
considered if not contraindicated.
2. Vascular calcifications in the cavernous carotid segments and
in the left distal vertebral artery, patency not assessed on the
present study.
.
[**4-9**] CXR-REASON FOR EXAM: Status post left hip resection with
increasing confusion. Comparison is made to prior study [**3-27**]
and [**2201-4-2**].
Compared to [**3-27**], there is new mild cardiomegaly. Dilatation
of the
ascending aorta is more notorious than before and warrants
further evaluation with either echo or CT. Asymmetrical apical
thickening is stable greater on the right. There is mild right
apical scarring.
There is no pneumothorax. There is a small left pleural
effusion.
.
RUQ u/s [**4-10**]-FINDINGS: Limited four-quadrant ultrasound of the
abdomen was performed. No free fluid was identified.
.
EKG [**4-11**]-Sinus rhythm. Early precordial QRS transition.
Borderline prolonged/upper
limits of QTc interval. Baseline artifact in the inferior leads
makes
assessment of those leads difficult. Findings are non-specific.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2201-3-7**] the QTc interval appears longer.
.
[**4-14**] CXR-REASON FOR EXAM: Delirium, status post left hip
hardware removal and fever.

Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with stable dilatation
of the
ascending aorta more conspicuous than in [**4-2**] and [**3-27**] .
Right greater than left apical pleural thickening is again noted
with scarring in the right apex. As mentioned in prior studies,
CT is recommended to assess the dilatation of the ascending
aorta and the right upper lobe pleuroparenchymal abnormality.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are no new
lung abnormalities.
.
cta chest [**4-16**]-
1. Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm,4.4 cm with dimensions as
reported
above.
2. Coronary and aortic valvular calcifications.
3. Severe emphysema.
4. Consolidative and ground-glass opacity in the superior
segments of the
left lower lobe. This is likely infectious or inflammatory in
etiology,
though malignancy cannot be excluded, and a followup chest CT in
three months is recommended. Smaller nodules as detailed above
can also be followed at that time.


.
[**4-16**] hip XR-
There has been removal of the hardware in the left hip since the
radiographs of [**2201-2-16**]. Compared to the most recent hip
radiographs rom [**2201-4-4**], there has been no significant
change. There are again seen cerclage bands within the proximal
femur. There is a perpendicular area of lucency in the proximal
femur shaft that is stable. There has been removal of the
surgical skin staples. The proximal femur is displaced
superiorly in relation to the acetabulum. Radiation seeds are
seen projecting over the prostate.  There are mild-to-moderate
degenerative changes of the right hip.

Brief Hospital Course:
This was written by your orthopedic team prior to transfer to
medicine, patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery
service and was taken to the operating room for above described
procedure. Please see separately dictated operative report for
details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated
the procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV
antibiotics.
.
Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
.
1. POD 0 - Patient was sent to the ICU from the PACU secondary
to hypovolemia and hypotension
2. Pancytopenia - Worse from baseline. Heme consulted, monitored
with daily CBCs, temporarily (5 days) stopped azathioprine, and
started on heparin 500units SC BID for DVT prophylaxis.
Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.
.
The patient's weight-bearing status is non weight bearing at all
times on the operative extremity with knee immobilizer on.

INTERNAL MEDICINE COURSE
Assessment/Plan: 62 yo male with history of HTN, GERD, EtOH
cirrhosis, Crohn's s/p ileostomy, COPD, depression,
pancytopenia, avascular necrosis [**1-7**] chronic prednisone use s/p
L hip replacement presenting originally for planned L hip
revision, but was found unable to be revised because of advanced
osteolysis, and so is now s/p total resection arthroplasty. Pt
noted to be encephalopathic after OR, initially medicine
consulted for AMS and ARF then pt was transferred to medicine.
.
#toxic metabolic encephalopathy- Pt with h.o ETOH related
cirrhosis. Per report, no recent drinking in 2 years-PCP and
family confirmed this. After procedure, pt had confusion,
agitation, and hallucinations. Pt had been ordered for higher
doses of oxycodone,  and benedryl, ativan, and flexeril were
ordered prior to medicine transfer. Labs were unrevealing, TSH
normal, Head CT without acute finding. Likely etiology was
medication effect from benzos, narcotics, flexeril in the
setting of poor hepatic and transient poor renal clearance. Pt
also was not sleeping at night. Pt with h.o ETOH abuse but no
recent drinking per report, ETOH withdrawal/DT's could have been
a consideration, but pt was without other signs of withdrawal
including HTN, tachycardia, diaphoresis. Pt, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pt's
family denied that that been had been drinking for last 2 years.
Pt also developed delerium 8 days into stay and initially
improved with lactulose, making ETOH withdrawal less likely.
Another consideration would be adrenal insufficiency but no
recent steroids, cortisol normal. Abd u/s without ascites. Pt
was placed on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, all narcotics and flexerill
were dc'd as well as benzos and benedryl. Pt's lactulose was
uptitrated to 60mg QID. Pt was given IV fluids in order to match
ostomy outpt from lactulose. Discussed case with patient's PCP
who reported that pt has had prior hepatic encephalopathy during
GI bleed. PCP suggested initiation of rifaximin and stopping
nadolol to improve blood flow to liver. All in all, likely toxic
encephalopathy due to medications, hepatic  causes and transient
ARF. Pt instructed  rifaximin until PCP follow up. Lactulose was
discontinued prior to discharge as pt had remained with a clear
mental status for days and had massive ostomy outpt causing
metabolic acidosis. Pt remained clear off lactulose. However,
should confusion reoccur, would start lactulose 30mL TID. Due to
severe pain, pt was restarted on oxycodone prior to discharge.
He did not have any confusion.
.
#acute renal failure-baseline Cr 0.8-1.1. Peaked at 2.2 and did
have a metabolic acidosis, initially gap, then became non-gap.
ARF improved with IVF. However, ARF transiently reoccurred with
increased lactulose dosing and massive ostomy outpt. Cr on
discharge 0.9. ACEI was restarted. See above, lactulose and IVF
stopped
.
#s/p L.hip hardware resection (h.o AVN due to prednisone-s/p
THA-now hardware resection)-No plans for OR until mid-[**Month (only) **]. Pt
will need rehab prior to OR procedure and returning home. Pt
will f/u with ortho after discharge to determine final course/OR
plan. Pain was controlled with standing tylenol (2grams
maximum). In addition, pt was started on lidocaine patch. As he
still had severe pain, and did have a clear mental status, low
dose oxycodone was restarted. PT followed the patient and
recommended rehab.
.
#hypernatremia-Thought to be due to increased ostomy outpt and
poor PO intake while encephalopathic. Pt received D51/2 NS with
improvement.
.
#Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm - ascending aorta measuring
up to 4.3 cm. Root approx 3.8 cm. Arch 2.8 cm. Descending 2.6
cm. Final measurements pending. No evidence of dissection or
other acute aortic syndrome. This was discussed with
cardiothoracic surgery who recommend appt with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
yearly CT scan for monitoring.
.
#incidental radiographic findings-"" Consolidative and
ground-glass opacity in the superior segments of the left lower
lobe. This is likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology,
though malignancy cannot be excluded, and a followup chest CT in
three months is recommended. Smaller nodules as detailed above
can also be followed at
that time"".
.
#h.o ETOH cirrhosis-h.o varices and 1 prior episode of
encephalopathy. Abdominal ultrasound without ascites. See above.
Pt was given lactulose, started on rifaximin and nadolol held.
Lactulose was discontinued prior to discharge as above.
Rifaximin was continued and nadolol was restarted at 20mg daily
given h.o varices. This may be uptitrated to 40mg daily if BP
allows. In addition, would restart lactulose for an signs of
encephalopathy/confusion
.
#metabolic acidosis-non-gap-from large ostomy output and IVF NS
repletion. Improved. Chemistry panel should be followed after
discharge.
.
#h.o Crohns-ileostomy care. Monitored ileostomy outpt. Continued
azathioprine.
.
#COPD-nebs given prn.
.
#GERD-continued PPI
.
#pancytopenia-thought to be related to cirrhosis, portal
sequestration, acute illness, and/or medication effect from
amongst other things, azithioprine. Counts improved. Counts were
monitored and actually improved during admission. However, WBC
decreased to 2.3 and plt to 87 on day of discharge. Labs
gradually  trended down to this over weekend. Considered
possibility of HIT. However, pt with plt count of 30 earlier in
course and had been on HEP SC BID. Plt count improved up to 160
while on heparin. However, counts gradually decreased to 87 on
day of discharge. Lovenox was started on [**4-19**] instead of hep SC.
In addition, as plt count trended down as did WBC. HIT score was
3 for (>50% drop, but was >day 10 of admit). Pt without any
signs of thrombosis. Pt will need to have WBC and platelet count
closely monitoring in the outpatient setting while on lovenox
and azathioprine. IF continues to decrease will need eval for
HIT and/or medication effect from azithioprine.
.
#ETOH abuse-Pt did not display signs of withdrawal (but did have
encephalopathy as above). Family/PCP report no drinking in
~2years. PT denied recent ETOH. Unlikely to be withdrawal as
delerium developed 8 days into stay.  He was placed on thiamine
and folate.
.
#HTn, benign-continued ACEI, while monitoring renal function.
(ACEI held during periods of ARF)
.
#depression-continued duloxetine, no signs of SI.
.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Failed L total hip replacement
hepatic encephalopathy
ETOH cirrhosis
toxic metabolic encephalopathy
pancytopenia
ascending thoracic aneurysm
Crohns disease
COPD


Discharge Condition:
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.

Mental Status: Clear and coherent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were initially admitted to the orthopedic service for L.hip
hardware removal. However, you then developed confusion which is
likely due to your known liver impairment and medications for
pain. You were given medications called lactulose and rifaximin
to help with confusion. Your nadolol was stopped to allow for
better blood flow to your liver, however this was restarted at
1/2 dose (20mg daily). Your pain medications were initially
stopped and you were placed on tylenol and a lidocaine patch.
Your confusion improved on this regimen and your lactulose was
able to be stopped and low dose oxycodone able to be restarted.
In addition, you were evaluated by physical therapy who
determined that you would benefit from a short stay in a rehab
facility.
.
In addition, you were found to have an aneurysm in your thoracic
aorta. This was discussed with you. The cardiothoracic team was
made aware and have suggested that you be evaluated in clinic.
Then you will need yearly evaluations in clinic with a CT scan.
.
You were found to have a haziness on your L.lung. This is likely
due to fluid. However, radiology has recommended that you have a
repeat CT scan in 3 month's time for reevaluation. Please
discuss this with your PCP.
.
The orthopedic doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] be deciding when to replace your
hip. PLease be sure to follow up in clinic for this issue.
.
Medication changes:
1.start lactulose for recurrent confusion
2.start rifaximin for confusion-please discuss with your
PCP/gastroenterologist on when to stop
3.start tylenol 650mg Three times a day for pain
4.stop oxycontin
5.stop ativan
6.lovenox injections daily to prevent blood clots
7.start nadolol at 20mg daily (instead of 40mg)
8.start oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
9.start lidocaine patch for pain.

These are instructions written below by the orthopedic team.
1. Please return to the emergency department or notify your
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5,
shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision
site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.

2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this
admission and any new medications and refills.

3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.

4. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by your
surgeon or your primary physician.

5. Please keep your wounds clean. You may shower starting five
(5) days after surgery, but no tub baths or swimming for at
least four (4) weeks. No dressing is needed if wound continues
to be non-draining. Any stitches or staples that need to be
removed will be taken out by the visiting nurse (VNA) or rehab
facility two
weeks after your surgery.

6. Please call your surgeon's office to schedule or confirm your
follow-up appointment in four (4) weeks.

7. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
medications (NSAIDs such as celebrex, ibuprofen, advil, aleve,
motrin, etc).

8. ANTICOAGULATION: please continue lovenox
 [**Male First Name (un) **] STOCKINGS x 6 WEEKS.

9. WOUND CARE: Please keep your incision clean and dry. It is
okay to shower five days after surgery but no tub baths,
swimming, or submerging your incision until after your four (4)
week checkup. Please place a dry sterile dressing on the wound
each day if there is drainage, otherwise leave it open to air.
Check wound regularly for signs of infection such as redness or
thick yellow drainage. Staples will be removed by the visiting
nurse or rehab facility in two (2) weeks.

10. VNA (once at home): Home PT/OT, dressing changes as
instructed, wound checks, and staple removal at two weeks after
surgery.

was noted to be confused coming out of the OR and overnight.  He
was initially  transferred to ICU post surgery because of
hypotension and was on pressors with subsequent normalization of
blood pressures.  Post-op course was also complicated by
hepatic/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, cleared with rifaximin
and lactulose, and by acute kidney injury.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. ICU Course:
# s/p left hip replacement:  Patient tolerated the procedure
well per Ortho although he did have significant blood loss and
fluid shifts. He had a RIJ placed in the OR the postition of
which was confirmed on presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Post-op Hct
stable at 33.2. He received ancef for 24 hours after the
procedure. Was intubated on admission to unit. He was cautiously
weaned from the vent and from Propofol given his prior history
of difficulty with extubation and altered mental status. Opiods
were avoided in management of the patient's pain. He was given
small fentanyl boluses for pain through the night. He was
extubated in the morning without difficulty. The JP drains
contained serosanginous fluid, and on POD1 the patient was
started on enoxaparin 40mg Sc daily. Pain management was an
issue given the patient's underlying hepatic dysfunction. The
acute pain and the chronic pain services were consulted
regarding a lumbosacral block. It was decided that in place of a
lumbosacral block, the patient's Dilaudid PCA would be increased
to dose to .24/6m and his long-acting oxycontin PO 10 mg Q6H.
The patient was successfully extubated upon leaving the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
# EtOH Cirrhosis - Blood transfusions and insult of surgery
would contribute to higher likelihood of post-op hepatic
encephalopathy.  Patient does have history of grade 1 varices as
well. Mental status was monitored through [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course and the
patient did not have hepatic encephalopathy on exam. Lactulose
was started after the patient was extubated. His home nadolol
was initially held [**1-7**] low BP, but this was restarted after
extubation.
.
# Pancytopenia - History of thrombocytopenia [**1-7**] cirrhosis as
well as pancytopenia, (which on previous workup by Heme/Onc was
felt to medication, portal sequestration).  Macrocytic anemia
consistent with history of alcohol and cirrhosis. CBC was
monitored with a goal of keeping platelets > 10 or 50 if acute
bleeding. Through his course in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient had an
active type and screen. No transfusions were required
post-operatively in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
# Crohn's disease - Stable, not having diarrhea. Continued with
azathioprine when taking POs.
.
# HTN - Initially held lisinopril for now pending fluid shifts
and post op hypotension.
.
# COPD - Documented h/o COPD in OMR but on no home medications.

# Ascending aortic aneurysm: Stable on recent Echo. VS were
monitored.
.
# Depression: Home duloxitine was continued.

2. Asymptomatic post-operative anemia - POD 2 Hct 21.1 ->
Transfused 2 units PRBCs

3. Medicine consult for co-management

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#2.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is TOUCHDOWN weight bearing
on the operative extremity with POSTERIOR and TROCHANTER OFF
precautions.

Mr. [**Known lastname 3265**] is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Cardiac cathetherization


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 81 yo female with a past medical history of
CAD with a 1 vessel CABG (SVG to LAD) in [**2134**] who presents with
chest pressure.  She woke up at 8 am with substernal chest
pressure.  It was severe initially.  She took SL NTG x3 with
relief of CP for a short period of time.  The CP radiated to her
right side and eventually down both arms.  She reports
diaphoresis, but denied associated nausea, vomiting,
lightheadedness or dizziness.  She reports that she has felt
mildly SOB since her recent pneumonia (first diagnosed appox [**6-24**]
weeks ago).  She denied worsening dyspnea.  Her cough has
improved substantially and is very minimal at this time.  She
went to her PCP's office and was found to have a new LBBB and
anterior ST elevations.  She was transferred to the ED. She
received Plavix 300mg, Aspirin, boluses of heparin and
integrillin. Code STEMI was called and went to the cath lab.
Cath showed occluded SVG, Native 3vd, occluded proximal LAD.
Wiring the LAD was difficult and there was concern about a
possible dissection. One BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.
Distal LAD is diminutive past 1st septal and diag branches.
She has been hemodynamically stable with HR 60-70s and SBP
120-130s.  On the floor, she is currently chest pain free and
feels well.
.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who
presented with an STEMI s/p catheterization and was incidentally
found to have multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with
adenocarcinoma.

#. STEMI: Pt presented with an anterior STEMI.  Her TIMI risk
score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new
or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent
revascularization.  Her SVG found to be completely occluded and
a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.  Due to the timing of the
SVG placement over 20 years ago, it was thought that her LAD had
managed to self revascularize and was partially supplied by the
RCA.  She was started on routine ACS medications: eptifibatide
for 18 hrs, plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, captopril,
and atorvastatin.  Cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately
with peak Ck and CKMB at 107 and 18.2.  There was concern for
acute heart failure from ischemic insult oxygen requirement.
However, she was noted to also have a RLL pneumonia and no
significant pulmonary edema (see below).  ECHO showed moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis.  Initially, patient  was started on coumadin for
ventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly
discontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit.

# Hypoxia:  Upon hospitalization, patient was maintaing
saturations in low 90s on 6L from baseline 92% on RA.  CXR
showed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole.  As the patient had
history recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which
showed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new
diffuse lung nodules with  sputum cytology positive for
adenocarcinoma.  Hypoxia was initially felt to be a combination
of postobstructive pneumonia and tumor burden from
adenocarcinoma.  Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin,
levofloxacin and flagyl of which she completed a 10 day course.
Repeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower
lobe infiltrate.  Respiratory status remained tenuous, patient
requiring high flow O2 with 6LNC with desaturations to high 70s
with activity.  Prior to discharge O2 requirement was 5L by
nasal cannula.  She was breathing comfortably with oxygen
saturation in the low 90s.  Likely this will continue to be
necessary for some time.  A shovel mask may be used to assist
with oxygenation as needed.

# Lung nodules/ Broncheoalveolar carcinoma: CT scan with diffuse
pulmonary nodules and sputum cytology positive for
adenocarcinoma.  Etiology was felt to be primary
bronchioalveolar vs metastatic thyroid dx (prior dx of possible
microfollicular carcinoma) although routine cancer screening was
not up-to-date.  A tissue diagnosis was not attained given the
patient's high oxygen requirement and anticoagulation with
plavix/asa in the setting of recent BMS placement.  Although
patient did not have imaging of her head, staging based on CT
torso was IIIa with pulmonary nodules in both lung fields
without obvious distal LAD or metastasis.  Empiric therapy with
single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] chemotherapy was initiated on [**1-7**] with
Pemetrexed.  She tolerated this well.  She received
dexamethasone on [**1-8**] to prevent rash.

# Chronic renal insufficiency - Patient with GFR 48.
Medications were renally dosed and renal function was carefully
followed.  She was treated prophylactically with mucomyst prior
to and post IV contrast dose.  Creatinine remained stable at
1-1.1.

# Hyperkalemia:  The patient was mildly hyperkalemic the day
prior to discharge to 5.6 without EKG changes.   This responded
promptly to kayexalate.  Electrolytes should be checked daily
until stable.  If necessary ACEI could be stopped.

# HTN:  She was normotensive on ACEI and b-blocker.

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty in breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 82 year-old female with a history of NSCLC
(stage IV) who presents with shortness of breath.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening
before admission when she began to feel somewhat short of
breath.  The next morning, this sensation persisted, so she
became concerned.  She also reports a few day history of a
non-productive cough.  Denies sick contacts, recent travel or
sedentary lifestyle.  She denied chest pain, fever, chills,
dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  She presented to the ED
where she was found to be hypoxic to the 70s on room air.
.
In the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather with sats up to
the high 90's.  Attempts were made to wean her to NC but they
were unsuccessful, as she was satting 88% on 4L NC.  She
remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.
Given that, she received levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Blood
cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.  CXR did
not show PNA, but demonstrated progression of known lung cancer.
 She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was
negative.  On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP-
112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB
.
On transfer to the ICU, the patient was stable and comfortable.
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower
extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
.


Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI [**2134**] s/p CABG [**2165**]
Hypertension
Dyslipidemia
CVA: small left posterior frontal infarct in [**12/2164**]
Macular Degeneration
NSCLC- stage IV (oncology history below)
.
-- [**12/2165**] presented in with unresolving right-sided pulmonary
infiltrate and an unrelated myocardial infarction.
-- [**2166-1-2**] Sputumcytology confirmed adenocarcinoma with a
pattern of stainpositivity consistent with lung origin (CK7 and
TTF-1 positive). She had stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer,
based on the multiple intrapulmonary lesions. She has no
evidence of extrathoracic or central nervous system involvement
with metastasis.
-- [**2166-1-7**]--->[**2166-5-6**]: Status post 6 cycles of pemetrexed
500->400>200 mg/m2 on [**2166-1-7**], [**2166-1-28**], [**2166-2-18**], [**2166-3-11**],
[**2166-4-1**], and [**2166-5-6**].  Her course was complicated by
cytopenias and development of increased creatinine levels.
-- [**2166-5-23**] Chest CT showed partial response with interval
improvement in the consolidation of the superior segment of the
right lower lobe and nodular densities of the left lower lobe.
Still widely disseminated BAC.
-- [**2166-8-13**] CT Chest shows increased density of right lower lobe
consolidation and worsened peribronchiolar ground-glass
opacities
in the lingula are most consistent with worsening of widely
disseminated non-small cell lung cancer, much less likely due to
infection.
-- [**2166-10-2**] Chest CT: slight interval progression of known
disease, no new sites.


Social History:
30 pack-year history of smoking.  Patient quit in [**2164**] but
resumed again.  Currently smokes 1 pack per week.  Drinks
socially.  Denies drug use. Married and lives with her husband.
She is a retired court reporter.


Family History:

.
CXR: [**2-13**]
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy. The
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There
continues to be progression of disease with increased extent of
consolidative opacity within the right lung base. Ill-defined
opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe are similar to
prior. Small right pleural effusion is present. There is no
pneumothorax. There is hyperinflation of the lungs.
IMPRESSION: Evidence of disease progression.
.
CT Head: [**2-13**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
recent infarction. An area of encephalomalacia in the left
frontal lobe,
compatible with chronic infarct is unchanged. Prominence of the
ventricles
and sulci reflects generalized atrophy, notably in the bifrontal
extraaxial spaces. Areas of periventricular and subcortical
white matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process or mass
effect
.
LENIs: [**2-14**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
.
CT chest [**2167-2-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities,
bronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula
and right
middle lobe. After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays
and CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening
bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change
rapid enough to suggest pneumonia. Of course pneumonia might be
present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the
basis of clinical findings.
2. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
3. Moderate emphysema.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
82yo female with NSCLC stage IV presents with hypoxia.
.
#. Hypoxia. On admission patient with chief complaints of
progressive shortness of breath and non-productive cough. No
home oxygen requirement at baseline. On admission she was placed
on NRB for treatment of O2 saturations in 70s saturations in the
70s.  Admission CXR with no definite infiltrate, though concern
for progression of her known lung disease. In setting of
elevated WBC. concern for infectious process and empirically
treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin in the ED. Transitioned
to monotherapy with levofloxacin on [**2-14**] and ceftriaxone was
later added on [**2-15**]. CXR on [**2-15**] demonstrates new left lower
lobe consolidation. Additional hypoxia work-up notable for
negative biomarkers, negative LENIs; unable to perform CTA due
to chronic kidney disease and creatinine 2.8. Patient was able
to be weaned back to room air by the end of her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay. She
was transferred to the medical floor on [**2-17**], where she
demonstrated exertional hypoxia, usually asymptomatic. Home O2
was arranged.
.
# Post-obstructive pneumonia. Consolidation of left lower lobe
evident on [**2-15**] likely secondary to infection rather than
progression of disease due to short time course of infiltrate
development (although on CT scan of [**2167-2-16**], the radiologist
concluded the opposite: that changes seen were likely caused by
her NSCLC, though pneumonia could not be absolutely ruled out).
Continued course of ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, which was
eventually narrowed to levofloxacin alone. Blood cultures no
growth to date. Multiple sputum cultures obtained; however, all
contaminated with oral flora. Urine legionella negative. Patient
did improve clinically with antibiotics, so she should complete
a [**10-30**] day course of levofloxacin.
.
#  NSCLC- stage IV. Not currently receiving chemotherapy.
Outpatient oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is planning on continued
surveillance with plan for possible further palliative systemic
chemotherapy if symptomatic progression of her disease is noted.
CT scan for evaluation of disease progression was obtained and
did show further progression. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] plans to weigh the risks
and benefits of additional chemotherapy, as it will be
complicated by her kidney dysfunction and other comorbidities.
He plans to repeat her CT scan once she completes her
antibiotics to further evaluate the rate of disease progression.
.
#  CAD s/p MI. Patient without chest pain; however, EKG with new
ST-depressions. Biomarkers cycled and negative x2. Patient
continued on home beta-blocker at a decreased dose due to
relative hypotension. She was maintained on aspirin, plavix, and
statin.
.
# chronic systolic CHF (LVEF 30-35% by TTE [**12-25**]):
Well-compensated. As described below, lasix was held but
B-blocker was given at a lower dose given relative hypotension
and exertional tachycardia.
.
#  CKD stage III: Creatinine on admission 2.8, down to 2.4 by
the time of discharge. She was given minimal IV fluids in the
ICU and her lasix was held. Throughout stay, patient had
adequate urine output.
.
#  Microcytic anemia. On presentation, patient's Hct likely
hemoconcentrated. Follow-up Hct found to be 20. No signs of
bleeding on exam. Patient transfused 2units of pRBC due to
history of CAD with appropriate elevation in hematocrit. The
hematocrit did remain steady during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course following
tranfusion. Just before transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's stool
guaiac was positive, which may call for further work-up. The
patient's anemia is most likely secondary to acute inflammation
in the setting of underlying chronic disease.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4612**] is a 83yo F with history of stage IV non-small
cell lung cancer, CAD and CKD who presents with dyspnea,
productive cough and melena. Patient has had 7-8 days of melena
without abdominal pain and dyspnea with worsening cough for the
past day. She denies fevers or chest pain.
.
In the ER, initial vitals were 97.2, 89, 156/53, 22, 86% 4L. Her
hct was 22 from recent baseline of 25 (she has transfusion
dependent anemia), and she initially was hypoxic. ABG was
7.29/64/42/32 and lactate was 2.4. Patient responded to nebs,
stress dose steroids, levaquin and ceftriaxone with improvement
in her sats to mid 90s on 5L NC. She was started on IV PPI for
her guaiac positive dark brown stool. CXR showed large R pleural
effusion and questionable L lower lobe collapse. EKG showed
sinus tach with ST depressions in V2-6. Vitals on transfer to
the MICU were 97.2, 105, 127/50, 29, 96% 5L NC.
.
In the MICU, she reports feeling better after her breathing
treatments today. She cannot recall when her difficulty
breathing started and per her family, she has difficulty hearing
but no memory loss. Patient had intermittent dyspnea for weeks
for which she previously took codeine syrup but then a period of
